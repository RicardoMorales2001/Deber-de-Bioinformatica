AB  - Snakes are fascinating creatures and have been residents of this planet well before 
      ancient humans dwelled the earth. Venomous snakes have been a figure of fear, and 
      cause notable mortality throughout the world. The venom constitutes families of 
      proteins and peptides with various isoforms that make it a cocktail of diverse 
      molecules. These biomolecules are responsible for the disturbance in fundamental 
      physiological systems of the envenomed victim, leading to morbidity which can lead 
      to death if left untreated. Researchers have turned these life-threatening toxins 
      into life-saving therapeutics via technological advancements. Since the development 
      of captopril, the first drug that was derived from bradykininpotentiating peptide of 
      Bothrops jararaca, to the disintegrins that have potent activity against certain 
      types of cancers, snake venom components have shown great potential for the 
      development of lead compounds for new drugs. There is a continuous development of 
      new drugs from snake venom for coagulopathy and hemostasis to anti-cancer agents. In 
      this review, we have focused on different snake venom proteins / peptides derived 
      drugs that are in clinical use or in developmental stages till to date. Also, some 
      commonly used snake venom derived diagnostic tools along with the recent updates in 
      this exciting field are discussed.

TI  - Bothrops Jararaca Snake Venom Modulates Key Cancer-Related Proteins in Breast Tumor 
      Cell Lines.

AB  - Cancer is characterized by the development of abnormal cells that divide in an 
      uncontrolled way and may spread into other tissues where they may infiltrate and 
      destroy normal body tissue. Several previous reports have described biochemical 
      anti-tumorigenic properties of crude snake venom or its components, including their 
      capability of inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell death. However, to 
      the best of our knowledge, there is no work describing cancer cell proteomic changes 
      following treatment with snake venoms. In this work we describe the quantitative 
      changes in proteomics of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast tumor cell lines following 
      treatment with Bothrops jararaca snake venom, as well as the functional implications 
      of the proteomic changes. Cell lines were treated with sub-toxic doses at either 
      0.63 μg/mL (low) or 2.5 μg/mL (high) of B. jararaca venom for 24 h, conditions that 
      cause no cell death per se. Proteomics analysis was conducted on a nano-scale liquid 
      chromatography coupled on-line with mass spectrometry (nLC-MS/MS). More than 1000 
      proteins were identified and evaluated from each cell line treated with either the 
      low or high dose of the snake venom. Protein profiling upon venom treatment showed 
      differential expression of several proteins related to cancer cell metabolism, 
      immune response, and inflammation. Among the identified proteins we highlight 
      histone H3, SNX3, HEL-S-156an, MTCH2, RPS, MCC2, IGF2BP1, and GSTM3. These data 
      suggest that sub-toxic doses of B. jararaca venom have potential to modulate 
      cancer-development related protein targets in cancer cells. This work illustrates a 
      novel biochemical strategy to identify therapeutic targets against cancer cell 
      growth and survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is the neoplasm with both the highest incidence and 
      mortality rate among women worldwide. Given the known snake venom cytotoxicity 
      towards several tumor types, we evaluated the effects of BthTX-I from Bothrops 
      jararacussu on MCF7, SKBR3, and MDAMB231 breast cancer cell lines. METHODS: BthTX-I 
      cytotoxicity was determined via MTT 
      3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazoliumbromide assay. Cell death was 
      measured by a hypotonic fluorescent solution method, annexin-V-FITC/propidium iodide 
      staining and by apoptotic/autophagic protein expression. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) 
      were quantified by flow cytometry using anti-CD24-FITC and anti-CD44-APC antibodies 
      and propidium iodide. RESULTS: BthTX-I at 102 µg/mL induced cell death in all cell 
      lines. The toxin induced apoptosis in MCF7, SKBR3, and MDAMB231 in a dose-dependent 
      manner, as confirmed by the increasing number of hypodiploid nuclei. Expression of 
      pro-caspase 3, pro-caspase 8 and Beclin-1 proteins were increased, while the level 
      of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was diminished in MCF7 cells. BthTX-I changed the 
      staining pattern of CSCs in MDAMB231 cells by increasing expression of CD24 
      receptors, which mediated cell death. CONCLUSIONS: BthTX-I induces apoptosis and 
      autophagy in all breast cancer cell lines tested and also reduces CSCs 
      subpopulation, which makes it a promising therapeutic alternative for breast cancer.

AB  - Peptides are small molecules composed of amino acids linked together by peptide 
      bonds. The targeted action of these peptides along with their magnificent ability to 
      reach locations in the body that are complicated to access, is being considered of 
      tremendous potential in disease modifying therapies. Synthetic as well as natural 
      peptides like Carnosine are currently under research for the treatment of 
      Neurodegenerative Disorders (NDDs). Peptide based vaccines are currently under 
      immense research for diseases like dementia. Toxicity of peptide-based drugs towards 
      eukaryotic cells due to their increased haemolytic activity is of major concern and 
      this is being tackled by introducing modifications into the peptide structure. Some 
      crucial peptide inhibitors currently in use for neurodegenerative disorders include 
      Aβ (16-20) KLVFF for Alzheimer's disease, NAPVSIPQ (NAP) for Parkinson's disease, 
      towards eukaryotic cells Vasoactive Intestinal Peptides (VIP) for Huntington's 
      disease, Polyglutamine Binding Peptide-1(QBP1) for Dentatorubral- pallidoluysian 
      atrophy (DRPLA). Certain peptides are involved in inhibition of Mitochondrial 
      Permeability Transition (MPT) that plays a prominent part in the materialization of 
      neurodegenerative diseases, one such example of peptides being Ba-V which is 
      obtained from Bothrops atrox snake venom. New therapeutic peptides are being 
      identified using bioinformatics tools like High Throughput Screening (HTS). These 
      tools are being used to explore the selectivity, stability, extent of immune 
      response and toxic side effects of peptides. Apart from neurodegenerative diseases, 
      the potential of bioactive peptides is also being tested against cancer, diabetes 
      and microbes. This review focuses on the recent advances in peptide therapeutics and 
      novel peptides discovered for the treatment of NDs.

AB  - This work shows the antitumor and antimetastatic effects of BthTX-II, an Asp-49 
      PLA(2) from Bothrops jararacussu venom, on MDA-MB-231 human triple negative breast 
      cancer cells. BthTX-II caused a dose-dependent cell death of MDA-MB-231 cells when 
      compared with the non-tumorigenic breast cells by inducing apoptosis and autophagy. 
      BthTX-II was also able to decrease the proliferation and to inhibit cell cycle 
      progression. We also observed an upregulation of the ATM gene, which is responsible 
      for cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair such as CCND1, CCNE1, CDC25A, E2F1, AKT1 and 
      AKT3. Interestingly, BthTX-II inhibited invasion, migration and 3D cell growth of 
      MDA-MB-231 cells, as well as inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) 
      of this cell by increasing E-cadherin (CDH-1) and decreasing TWIST1, CTNNB1, 
      vimentin and cytokeratin-5 expression. In conclusion, these results showed that 
      BthTX-II displays antitumor and antimetastatic effects on MDA-MB-231 cells and may 
      be useful for the development of new approaches and therapeutic strategies to manage 
      triple negative breast cancer.

AB  - Leucurogin is an ECD disintegrin-like protein, cloned from Bothrops leucurus venom 
      gland. This new protein, encompassing the disintegrin region of a PIII 
      metalloproteinase, is produced by recombinant technology and its biological and 
      functional activity was partially characterized in this study. Biological activity 
      was characterized in vitro using human fibroblasts. Functional activity of 
      leucurogin was analysed in vitro and in vivo with murine B16F10 Nex-2 and human 
      melanoma BLM cells. The results show that leucurogin inhibits cellular processes 
      dependent on collagen type I. In a competition assay with collagen, leucurogin 
      inhibits, in a dose-dependent manner, the adhesion of fibroblast to collagen. At 
      10 μM leucurogin reduces adhesion (40%) and migration (70%) of hFb and inhibits 
      migration (32%) and proliferation (65%) of BLM cells. At 2.5 μM leucurogin inhibits 
      80% cell proliferation of B16F10 Nex-2 melanoma cells. At 4.8 μM leucurogin 
      inhibits, in vitro, the vascular structures formation by endothelial cells by 66%. 
      Leucurogin, injected intraperitoneally, i.p. (5 μg/animal, two-month old C57/Bl6 
      male mice) on alternate days for 15 days, inhibits lung metastasis of B16F10 
      Nex-2 cells by 70-75%. In the treatment of human melanoma, grafted intradermally in 
      the nude mice flank, leucurogin (7.5 μg/kg in alternate days during 17 days) 
      inhibits tumor growth by more than 40%. Leucurogin can be considered a promising 
      agent for melanoma treatment.

TI  - Bothrops jararaca and Bothrops erythromelas Snake Venoms Promote Cell Cycle Arrest 
      and Induce Apoptosis via the Mitochondrial Depolarization of Cervical Cancer Cells.
PG  - 1574971

AB  - Bothrops jararaca (BJ) and Bothrops erythromelas (BE) are viper snakes found in 
      South-Southeast and Northeast regions of Brazil, respectively. Snake venoms are 
      bioactive neurotoxic substances synthesized and stored by venom glands, with 
      different physiological and pharmacological effects, recently suggesting a possible 
      preference for targets in cancer cells; however, mechanisms of snakes have been 
      little studied. Here, we investigated the mechanism responsible for snake crude 
      venoms toxicity in cultured cervical cancer cells SiHa and HeLa. We show that BJ and 
      BE snake crude venoms exert cytotoxic effects to these cells. The percentage of 
      apoptotic cells and cell cycle analysis and cell proliferation were assessed by flow 
      cytometry and MTT assay. Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential 
      (Rhodamine-123), nuclei morphological change, and DNA fragmentation were examined by 
      staining with DAPI. The results showed that both the BJ and BE venoms were capable 
      of inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, promoting cytotoxicity and death by 
      apoptosis of target SiHa and HeLa cells when treated with BJ and BE venoms. 
      Furthermore, data revealed that both BJ venoms in SiHa cell promoted nuclear 
      condensation, fragmentation, and formation of apoptotic bodies by DAPI assay, 
      mitochondrial damage by Rhodamine-123, and cell cycle block in the G1-G0 phase. BJ 
      and BE venoms present anticancer potential, suggesting that both Bothrops venoms 
      could be used as prototypes for the development of new therapies.

TI  - Genotoxic effects of BnSP-6, a Lys-49 phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) homologue from 
      Bothrops pauloensis snake venom, on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

AB  - Herein we evaluated the genotoxic effects of BnSP-6, a Lys-49 phospholipase A(2) 
      (PLA(2)) from Bothrops pauloensis, on breast cancer cells. BnSP-6 was able to induce 
      a higher cytotoxic and genotoxic activity in MDA-MB-231 cells, when compared to 
      MCF10A (a non-tumorigenic breast cell line), suggesting that this protein presented 
      a possible preference for cancer cells. BnSP-6 inhibited MDA-MB-231 proliferation at 
      24, 48 and 72 h. In addition, BnSP-6 induced significant increase in the percentage 
      of TUNEL-positive cells, a marker of DNA damage. To obtain novel insight into the 
      direct DNA damage interference in MDA-MB-231 survival and proliferation, we 
      evaluated cell cycle progression. BnSP-6 produced a significant decrease in 2N (G1) 
      and an increase in the G2/M phase and this capacity is likely related to the 
      modulation of expression of progression cell cycle-associated genes (CCND1, CCNE1, 
      CDC25A, CHEK2, E2F1, CDH-1 and NF-kB). Taken together, these results indicate that 
      BnSP-6 induces DNA damage in breast cancer cells and is an attractive model for 
      developing innovative therapeutic agents against breast cancer.

AB  - Jararhagin is a metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops jararaca snake venom, which 
      has been extensively studied. These studies showed its involvement on most of the 
      systemic and local damaging effects of snakebite envenomings. In this review we 
      comment on the major targets of jararhagin as the vascular endothelium, platelets 
      and coagulation factors and also its action on other cell systems as inflammatory 
      cells and their mediators, cancer and cell signaling. The mechanisms of jararhagin 
      action are discussed together with structural features essential for the expression 
      of its biological activities. The studies reviewed here denote jararhagin as a 
      prototype for studies of snake venom metalloproteinases, bringing new insights into 
      cellular-matrix interactions and adding for the improvement of snakebite treatment.

AB  - This work shows the antitumoral effects of BnSP-6, a Lys 49 PLA2 isolated from 
      Bothrops pauloensis venom, on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. BnSP-6 caused a 
      dose-dependent cytotoxicity and inhibited cell adhesion. Interestingly, cytotoxic 
      activity of BnSP-6 was significantly lower against MCF10A, a non-tumorigenic breast 
      cell line, suggesting that this PLA2 presented a possible preference for targets in 
      cancer cells. Analysis of cell death on MDA-MB-231 cells showed that BnSP-6 
      stimulated the autophagy process, as evidenced by labeling of autophagic vacuoles. 
      Moreover, apoptosis assays showed that BnSP-6 induced both early and late apoptosis. 
      Apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells was also confirmed by up-regulation of different genes 
      related to the apoptosis pathway, such as TNF, TNFRSF10B, TNFRSF1A and CASP8 and 
      decreased expression of anti-apoptotic genes (BCL2 and BCL2L). In addition, BnSP-6 
      caused a remarkable increase in gene expression of BRCA2 and TP53 tumor suppressors. 
      Finally, BnSP-6 induced down-regulation of Angiopoetin 1 gene (potent pro-angiogenic 
      factor) and inhibited adhesion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells suggesting 
      pharmaceutical applications of this PLA2 as an antiangiogenic and anti-metastatic 
      agent. Taken together, our results show that the PLA2 BnSP-6 presents anticancer 
      potential that can be exploited as prototype for the design of new therapies.

AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the involvement of caspases in apoptosis 
      induced by l-amino acid oxidase isolated from Bothrops atrox snake venom. The 
      isolation of LAAO involved three chromatographic steps: molecular exclusion on a 
      G-75 column; ion exchange column by HPLC and affinity chromatography on a Lentil 
      Lectin column. SDS-PAGE was used to confirm the expected high purity level of 
      BatroxLAAO. It is a glycoprotein with 12% sugar and an acidic character, as 
      confirmed by its amino acid composition, rich in "Asp and Glu" residues. It displays 
      high specificity toward hydrophobic l-amino acids. The N-terminal amino acid 
      sequence and internal peptide sequences showed close structural homology to other 
      snake venom LAAOs. This enzyme induces in vitro platelet aggregation, which may be 
      due to H2O2 production by LAAOs, since the addition of catalase completely inhibited 
      the aggregation effect. It also showed cytotoxicity towards several cancer cell 
      lines: HL60, Jurkat, B16F10 and PC12. The cytotoxicity activity was abolished by 
      catalase. A fluorescence microscopy evaluation revealed a significant increase in 
      the apoptotic index of these cells after BatroxLAAO treatment. This observation was 
      confirmed by phosphatidyl serine exposure and activation of caspases. BatroxLAAO is 
      a protein with various biological functions that can be involved in envenomation. 
      Further investigations of its function will contribute to toxicology advances.

AB  - A 15-year-old captive female Urutu snake (Bothrops alternatus) was presented with 
      anorexia, apathy, dehydration, pale mucous membranes and marked enlargement of the 
      caudal third of the coelomic cavity. Radiographs and ultrasonography were suggestive 
      of faecal impaction or neoplasia. Post-mortem findings consisted of solid faecal 
      impaction of the intestines, secondary to obstruction caused by a rectal tumour. 
      Cytological examination of impression smears of the tumour revealed polygonal to 
      round neoplastic cells arranged in clusters in an abundant extracellular mucinous 
      matrix. Histologically, there was transmural growth of neoplastic epithelial cells 
      arranged in small nests or individually and immersed in abundant extracellular mucin 
      lakes. The neoplastic cells were immunopositive for cytokeratin. Clinical and 
      pathological aspects indicated a diagnosis of mucinous rectal adenocarcinoma.

AB  - Breast cancer is a highly malignant carcinoma and remains the second leading cause 
      of mortality among women. The antitumor effects of metalloproteinases and 
      disintegrins from snake venom on various types of cancer cells have been 
      investigated. In this study, we evaluated the antitumor and antiangiogenic effects 
      on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells and endothelial cells induced by 
      Bothropoidin, a disintegrin-like metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops pauloensis 
      snake venom. At 24h after treatment at 100μg/mL, Bothropoidin exerted a moderate 
      cytotoxic effect of 30% on MDA-MB-231 versus 10% cytotoxicity against MCF10A (a 
      non-tumorigenic breast cell line), a significant difference that suggests a possible 
      preference by this protein for targets in cancer cells. Early and late apoptosis of 
      MDA-MB-231 was observed after Bothropoidin treatment (10μg/mL and 40μg/mL). 
      Furthermore, this toxin inhibited not only the adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells in a 
      dose-dependent manner but also cell migration by approximately 45%. In addition, 
      Bothropoidin decreased endothelial cells viability and adhesion in Matrigel and 
      inhibited in vitro angiogenesis in Matrigel stimulated by bFGF, showing 
      significantly fewer formed vessels. The results demonstrated that Bothropoidin has 
      potent in vitro antitumor and antiangiogenic effect and represents a 
      biotechnological tool for elucidating the antitumor effect of disintegrins-like 
      metalloproteinases in cancer cells.

AB  - BACKGROUND: L-amino acid oxidases isolated from snake venoms (SV-LAAOs) are enzymes 
      that have great therapeutic potential and are currently being investigated as tools 
      for developing new strategies to treat various diseases, including cancer and 
      bacterial infections. The main objective of this study was to make a brief 
      evaluation of the enzymatic stability of two Bothrops LAAOs, one isolated from 
      Bothrops jararacussu (BjussuLAAO-II) and the other from Bothrops moojeni 
      (BmooLAAO-I) venoms. METHODS AND RESULTS: The enzymatic activity and stability of 
      both LAAOs were evaluated by microplate colorimetric assays, for which BjussuLAAO-II 
      and BmooLAAO-I were incubated with different L-amino acid substrates, in the 
      presence of different ions, and at different pH ranges and temperatures. 
      BjussuLAAO-II and BmooLAAO-I demonstrated higher affinity for hydrophobic amino 
      acids, such as Phe and Leu. The two enzymes showed high enzymatic activity in a wide 
      temperature range, from 25 to 75 °C, and presented optimum pH around 7.0. 
      Additionally, Zn(2+), Al(3+), Cu(2+) and Ni(2+) ions negatively modulated the 
      enzymatic activity of both LAAOs. As to stability, BjussuLAAO-II and BmooLAAO-I 
      showed high enzymatic activity for 42 days stored at 4 °C in neutral pH solution. 
      Moreover, the glycan portions of both LAAOs were analyzed by capillary 
      electrophoresis, which revealed that BjussuLAAO-II presented two main glycan 
      portions with relative masses of 7.78 and 8.13 CGU, while BmooLAAO-I showed three 
      portions of 7.58, 7.94 and 8.37 CGU. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that, when 
      stored properly, BjussuLAAO-II and BmooLAAO-I present enzymatic stability over a 
      long time period, which is very important to allow the use of these enzymes in 
      pharmacological studies of great impact in the medical field.

AB  - Antiangiogenic strategies are promising tools for cancer treatment and several other 
      disorders. In this sense, phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s) from snake venom have been 
      described to possess antiangiogenic properties. In this study, we evaluated both in 
      vitro and ex vivo antiangiogenic effects induced by BnSP-7, a Lys49 PLA(2) isolated 
      from Bothrops pauloensis snake venom. BnSP-7 was able to inhibit endothelial cell 
      (HUVEC) proliferation, which was indeed confirmed by a modulation of cell cycle 
      progression. Interestingly, BnSP-7 also inhibited the adhesion and migration of 
      HUVECs and blocked in vitro angiogenesis in a VEGF-dependent manner, an important 
      proangiogenic factor. Finally, BnSP-7 was capable of inhibiting sprouting angiogenic 
      process through an ex vivo aortic ring assay. Taken together, these results indicate 
      that BnSP-7 has potent in vitro and ex vivo antiangiogenic effect.

AB  - A thrombin-like enzyme, pictobin, was purified from Bothrops pictus snake venom. It 
      is a 41-kDa monomeric glycoprotein as showed by mass spectrometry and contains 
      approx. 45% carbohydrate by mass which could be removed with N-glycosidase. Pictobin 
      coagulates plasma and fibrinogen, releasing fibrinopeptide A and induces the 
      formation of a friable/porous fibrin network as visualized by SEM. The enzyme 
      promoted platelet aggregation in human PRP and defibrination in mouse model and 
      showed catalytic activity on chromogenic substrates S-2266, S-2366, S-2160 and 
      S-2238. Pictobin interacts with the plasma inhibitor α2-macroglobulin, which blocks 
      its interaction with fibrinogen but not with the small substrate BApNA. Heparin does 
      not affect its enzymatic activity. Pictobin cross reacted with polyvalent bothropic 
      antivenom, and its deglycosylated form reduced its catalytic action and antivenom 
      reaction. In breast and lung cancer cells, pictobin inhibits the 
      fibronectin-stimulated migration. Moreover, it produces strong NADH oxidation, 
      mitochondrial depolarization, ATP decrease and fragmentation of mitochondrial 
      network. These results suggest by first time that a snake venom serinprotease 
      produces mitochondrial dysfunction by affecting mitochondrial dynamics and 
      bioenergetics. Structural model of pictobin reveals a conserved chymotrypsin fold 
      β/β hydrolase. These data indicate that pictobin has therapeutic potential in the 
      treatment of cardiovascular disorders and metastatic disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lack of complete genomic data of Bothrops jararaca impedes molecular 
      biology research focusing on biotechnological applications of venom gland 
      components. Identification of full-length coding regions of genes is crucial for the 
      correct molecular cloning design. METHODS: RNA was extracted from the venom gland of 
      one adult female specimen of Bothrops jararaca. Deep sequencing of the mRNA library 
      was performed using Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. De novo assembly of B. jararaca 
      transcriptome was done using Trinity. Annotation was performed using Blast2GO. All 
      predicted proteins after clustering step were blasted against non-redundant protein 
      database of NCBI using BLASTP. Metabolic pathways present in the transcriptome were 
      annotated using the KAAS-KEGG Automatic Annotation Server. Toxins were identified in 
      the B. jararaca predicted proteome using BLASTP against all protein sequences 
      obtained from Animal Toxin Annotation Project from Uniprot KB/Swiss-Pro database. 
      Figures and data visualization were performed using ggplot2 package in R language 
      environment. RESULTS: We described the in-depth transcriptome analysis of B. 
      jararaca venom gland, in which 76,765 de novo assembled isoforms, 96,044 transcribed 
      genes and 41,196 unique proteins were identified. The most abundant transcript was 
      the zinc metalloproteinase-disintegrin-like jararhagin. Moreover, we identified 78 
      distinct functional classes of proteins, including toxins, inhibitors and tumor 
      suppressors. Other venom proteins identified were the hemolytic lethal factors 
      stonustoxin and verrucotoxin. CONCLUSION: It is believed that the application of 
      deep sequencing to the analysis of snake venom transcriptomes may represent 
      invaluable insight on their biotechnological potential focusing on candidate 
      molecules.

TI  - Revisiting the Therapeutic Potential of Bothrops jararaca Venom: Screening for Novel 
      Activities Using Connectivity Mapping.
LID - 10.3390/toxins10020069 [doi]
LID - 69
AB  - Snake venoms are sources of molecules with proven and potential therapeutic 
      applications. However, most activities assayed in venoms (or their components) are 
      of hemorrhagic, hypotensive, edematogenic, neurotoxic or myotoxic natures. Thus, 
      other relevant activities might remain unknown. Using functional genomics coupled to 
      the connectivity map (C-map) approach, we undertook a wide range indirect search for 
      biological activities within the venom of the South American pit viper Bothrops 
      jararaca. For that effect, venom was incubated with human breast adenocarcinoma cell 
      line (MCF7) followed by RNA extraction and gene expression analysis. A list of 90 
      differentially expressed genes was submitted to biosimilar drug discovery based on 
      pattern recognition. Among the 100 highest-ranked positively correlated drugs, only 
      the antihypertensive, antimicrobial (both antibiotic and antiparasitic), and 
      antitumor classes had been previously reported for B. jararaca venom. The majority 
      of drug classes identified were related to (1) antimicrobial activity; (2) treatment 
      of neuropsychiatric illnesses (Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and 
      epilepsy); (3) treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and (4) anti-inflammatory 
      action. The C-map results also indicated that B. jararaca venom may have components 
      that target G-protein-coupled receptors (muscarinic, serotonergic, histaminergic, 
      dopaminergic, GABA, and adrenergic) and ion channels. Although validation 
      experiments are still necessary, the C-map correlation to drugs with activities 
      previously linked to snake venoms supports the efficacy of this strategy as a 
      broad-spectrum approach for biological activity screening, and rekindles the snake 
      venom-based search for new therapeutic agents.

AB  - Phospholipase A(2) Bothropstoxin-I (PLA(2) BthTX-I) is a myotoxic Lys49-PLA(2) from 
      Bothrops jararacussu snake venom. In order to evaluate the DNA damage caused by 
      BthTX-I, we used the Somatic Mutation and Recombination Test (SMART) in Drosophila 
      melanogaster and Comet assay in HUVEC and DU-145 cells. For SMART, different 
      concentrations of BthTX-I (6.72 to 430 μg/mL) were used and no significant changes 
      in the survival rate were observed. Significant frequency of mutant spots was 
      observed for the ST cross at the highest concentration of BthTX-I due to 
      recombinogenic activity. In the HB cross, BthTX-I increased the number of mutant 
      spots at intermediate concentrations, being 53.75 μg/mL highly mutagenic and 107.5 
      μg/mL predominantly recombinogenic. The highest concentrations were neither 
      mutagenic nor recombinogenic, which could indicate cytotoxicity in the wing cells of 
      D. melanogaster. In vitro, all BthTX-I concentrations (1 to 50 μg/mL) induced 
      decrease in HUVEC cell viability, as well as in DU-145 cells at concentrations of 
      10, 25, and 50 μg/mL. The comet assay showed that in HUVEC and DU-145 cells, all 
      BthTX-I concentrations promoted increase of DNA damage. Further studies should be 
      performed to elucidate the mechanism of action of PLA(2) BthTX-I and its possible 
      use in therapeutic strategies against cancer.

TI  - Jararhagin, a snake venom metalloproteinase, induces mechanical hyperalgesia in mice 
      with the neuroinflammatory contribution of spinal cord microglia and astrocytes.

AB  - Jararhagin is a hyperalgesic metalloproteinase from Bothrops jararaca venom. In 
      rodents, jararhagin induces nociceptive behaviors that correlate with an increase in 
      peripheral cytokine levels. However, the role of the spinal cord glia in pain 
      processing after peripheral stimulus of jararhagin has not been investigated. Aiming 
      to explore this proposal, mice received intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of jararhagin 
      and the following parameters were evaluated: hyperalgesia, spinal cord TNF-α, IL-1β 
      levels, and CX(3)CR1, GFAP and p-NFκB activation. The effects of intrathecal (i.t.) 
      injection of TNF-α soluble receptor (etanercept), IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), 
      and inhibitors of NFκB (PDTC), microglia (minocycline) and astrocytes 
      (α-aminoadipate) were investigated. Jararhagin inoculation induced cytokine 
      production (TNF-α and IL-1β) in the spinal cord, which was reduced by treatment with 
      PDTC (40% and 50%, respectively). Jararhagin mechanical hyperalgesia and cytokine 
      production were inhibited by treatment with etanercept (67%), IL-1Ra (60%), PDTC 
      (70%), minocycline (60%) and α-aminoadipate (45%). Furthermore, jararhagin induced 
      an increase in p-NFκB, CX(3)CR1 and GFAP detection in the spinal cord indicating 
      activation of NFκB, microglia and astrocytes. These results demonstrate for the 
      first time that jararhagin-induced mechanical hyperalgesia is dependent on spinal 
      cord activation of glial cells, consequent NFκB activation, and cytokine production 
      in mice.

AB  - Manifestations of local tissue damage, such as hemorrhage and myonecrosis, are among 
      the most dramatic effects of envenomation by viperid snakes. Snake venom 
      metalloproteinases (SVMPs) of the P-III class are main players of the hemorrhagic 
      effect due to their activities in promoting blood vessel disruption. Hemorrhagic 
      Factor 3 (HF3), a P-III class SVMP from Bothrops jararaca, shows a minimum 
      hemorrhagic dose of 240 fmol on rabbit skin. The aim of this study was to assess the 
      effects of a sub-cytotoxic dose of HF3 (50 nM) on the proteomic profile of C2C12 
      differentiated cells (myotubes) in culture, and on the peptidomic profile of the 
      culture supernatant. Quantitative proteomic analysis using stable-isotope dimethyl 
      labeling showed differential abundance of various proteins including enzymes 
      involved in oxidative stress and inflammation responses. Identification of peptides 
      in the supernatant of HF3-treated myotubes revealed proteolysis and pointed out 
      potential new substrates of HF3, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 
      and some damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). These experiments demonstrate 
      the subtle effects of HF3 on muscle cells and illustrate for the first time the 
      early proteolytic events triggered by HF3 on myotubes. Moreover, they may contribute 
      to future studies aimed at explaining the inflammation process, hemorrhage and 
      myonecrosis caused by SVMPs. SIGNIFICANCE: One of the main features of viperid snake 
      envenomation is myotoxicity at the bite site, which, in turn is often associated 
      with edema, blistering and hemorrhage, composing a complex pattern of local tissue 
      damage. In this scenario, besides muscle cells, other types of cells, components of 
      the extracellular matrix and blood vessels may also be affected, resulting in an 
      outcome of deficient muscle regeneration. The main venom components participating in 
      this pathology are metalloproteinases and phospholipases A2. Muscle necrosis induced 
      by metalloproteinases is considered as an indirect effect related to ischemia, due 
      to hemorrhage resulted from damage to the microvasculature. The pathogenesis of 
      local effects induced by Bothrops venoms or isolated toxins has been studied by 
      traditional methodologies. More recently, proteomic and peptidomic approaches have 
      been used to study venom-induced pathogenesis. Here, in order to investigate the 
      role of metalloproteinase activity in local tissue damage, we asked whether the 
      hemorrhagic metalloproteinase HF3, at sub-cytotoxic levels, could alter the proteome 
      of C2C12 myotubes in culture, thereby providing an insight into the mechanisms for 
      the development of myonecrosis. Our results from mass spectrometric analyses showed 
      subtle, early changes in the cells, including differential abundance of some 
      proteins and proteolysis in the culture supernatant. The data illustrate the 
      potential ability of metalloproteinases to trigger early systemic responses 
      progressing from local cells and up to tissues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of animal venoms and their toxins as material sources for 
      biotechnological applications has received much attention from the pharmaceutical 
      industry. L-amino acid oxidases from snake venoms (SV-LAAOs) have demonstrated 
      innumerous biological effects and pharmacological potential against different cancer 
      types. Hepatocellular carcinoma has increased worldwide, and the aberrant DNA 
      methylation of liver cells is a common mechanism to promote hepatic tumorigenesis. 
      Moreover, tumor microenvironment plays a major role in neoplastic transformation. To 
      elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the cytotoxic effects of SV-LAAO 
      in human cancer cells, this study aimed to evaluate the cytotoxicity and the 
      alterations in DNA methylation profiler in the promoter regions of cell-cycle genes 
      induced by BjussuLAAO-II, an LAAO from Bothrops jaracussu venom, in human 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells in monoculture and co-culture with 
      endothelial (HUVEC) cells. METHODS: BjussuLAAO-II concentrations were 0.25, 0.50, 
      1.00 and 5.00 μg/mL. Cell viability was assessed by MTT assay and DNA methylation of 
      the promoter regions of 22 cell-cycle genes by EpiTect Methyl II PCR array. RESULTS: 
      BjussuLAAO-II decreased the cell viability of HepG2 cells in monoculture at all 
      concentrations tested. In co-culture, 1.00 and 5.00 μg/mL induced cytotoxicity (p < 
      0.05). BjussuLAAO-II increased the methylation of CCND1 and decreased the 
      methylation of CDKN1A in monoculture and GADD45A in both cell-culture models (p < 
      0.05). CONCLUSION: Data showed BjussuLAAO-II induced cytotoxicity and altered DNA 
      methylation of the promoter regions of cell-cycle genes in HepG2 cells in 
      monoculture and co-culture models. We suggested the analysis of DNA methylation 
      profile of GADD45A as a potential biomarker of the cell cycle effects of 
      BjussuLAAO-II in cancer cells. The tumor microenvironment should be considered to 
      comprise part of biotechnological strategies during the development of 
      snake-toxin-based novel drugs.

TI  - Alternagin-C, an alpha2beta1 integrin ligand, attenuates collagen-based adhesion, 
      stimulating the metastasis suppressor 1 expression in triple-negative breast tumor 
      cells.

AB  - Triple-negative breast cancer has an aggressive clinical course and its treatment 
      has been challenging due to high metastatic risk. Molecular targets have been sought 
      to provide better strategies for this type of cancer. Integrins are cell adhesion 
      receptors involved in tumor progression and α(2)β(1) integrin, a collagen receptor, 
      has a key role in breast metastasis. Disintegrins, a family of proteins from snake 
      venoms, selectively block the function of integrin receptors. Alternagin-C (ALT-C), 
      a disintegrin-like protein purified from Bothrops alternatus venom, binds to 
      α(2)β(1) integrin, attenuating inflammation and angiogenesis, and decreasing 
      metalloprotease levels in the tumor microenvironment, which suggests anti-metastatic 
      effects. However, its mechanisms of action in metastatic tumor cells have not been 
      fully explored. Here, we investigated ALT-C effects in a triple-negative breast 
      cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) to elucidate how α(2)β(1) integrin affects cellular 
      adhesion, migration and gene expression related to metastasis. We observed that 
      ALT-C attenuated cell adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to collagen I. α(2) integrin 
      subunit silencing in MDA-MB-231 cells did not inhibit cell adhesion and migration to 
      collagen I, indicating that other integrins play a crucial role in cell motility for 
      this cell line. ALT-C also stimulated the metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) expression 
      and decreased metalloproteases MMP9 and MMP2. Therefore, we suggest that ALT-C 
      contributes to impair metastasis, preventing extracellular matrix degradation and 
      tumor attachment to collagen I, increasing MTSS1. This study is the first to 
      elucidate the anti-metastatic mechanism involving a disintegrin-like protein from 
      snake venom targeting α(2)β(1) integrin and stimulating a metastasis suppressor.

AB  - Bradykinin-potentiating peptides (BPPs - 5a, 7a, 9a, 10c, 11e, and 12b) of Bothrops 
      jararaca (Bj) were described as argininosuccinate synthase (AsS) activators, 
      improving l-arginine availability. Agmatine and polyamines, which are l-arginine 
      metabolism products, have neuroprotective properties. Here, we investigated the 
      neuroprotective effects of low molecular mass fraction from Bj venom (LMMF) and two 
      synthetic BPPs (BPP-10c, <ENWPHPQIPP; BPP-12b, <EWGRPPGPPIPP) in the SH-SY5Y cell 
      line against H(2)O(2)-induced oxidative stress. The neuroprotective effects against 
      H(2)O(2)-induced were analyzed by reactive oxygen species (ROS - DCFH) production; 
      lipid peroxidation (TBARS); intracellular GSH; AsS, iNOS, and NF-kB expressions; 
      nitrite levels (Griess); mitochondrial membrane potential (TMRM); and antioxidant 
      activity (DPPH). Analysis of variance followed by Tukey's post hoc test were 
      calculated for statistical comparisons. Pre-treatment with both BPPs significantly 
      reduced cell death induced by H(2)O(2), but BPP-10c showed higher protective 
      capacity than BPP-12b. LMMF pretreatment was unable to prevent the reduction of cell 
      viability caused by H(2)O(2). The neuroprotective mechanism of BPP-10c against 
      oxidative stress was investigated. BPP-10c reduced ROS generation and lipid 
      peroxidation in relation to cells treated only with H(2)O(2). BBP-10c increased AsS 
      expression and was not neuroprotective in the presence of MDLA, a specific inhibitor 
      of AsS. BPP-10c reduced iNOS expression and nitrate levels but decreased NF-kB 
      expression. Furthermore, BPP-10c protected the mitochondrial membrane against 
      oxidation. Overall, we demonstrated for the first time neuroprotective mechanisms of 
      BPPs against oxidative stress, opening new perspectives to the study and application 
      of these peptides for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - In vitro studies on Bothrops venoms cytotoxic effect on tumor cells.
PG  - 249-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: Animal venoms are complex mixtures of proteins and non proteins 
      components with several biological activities. Snake venoms represent an essentially 
      unexplored source of bioactive compounds that may cure disease conditions which do 
      not respond to currently available therapies. These venoms possess many 
      pharmacological activities, as cytotoxic and/or lytic effects on tumor cells in 
      vitro. Herein, were investigated the in vitro cytotoxicity of three Bothrops venoms 
      in tumor cell lines. METHODS: Cytotoxic effect was evaluated in HCT-8 (colon - 
      human), SF-295 (nervous system - human), HL-60 (human leukemia) and MDAMB-435 
      (breast - human). Cell density and membrane integrity were determined by the 
      exclusion of propidium iodide. To determine whether Bothrops venoms treated cells 
      were undergoing an apoptotic and/ or necrosis death, phosphatidylserine (PS) 
      externalization was measured after the incubation with the venom. RESULTS: Botrhops 
      venons showed significant cytotoxcity against all cell lines in study. Cell density 
      and membrane integrity were determined by the exclusion of propidium iodide. The 
      Bothrops venoms reduced the cell number and revealed the presence of a necrotic 
      population when the cells was exposed to the B. pauloensis B. diporus and B. pirajai 
      venoms. To determine whether Bothrops venoms treated cells were undergoing an 
      apoptotic and/or necrosis death, PS externalization was measured after the 
      incubation with the venom and it was observed necrotic and apoptotic cells. 
      CONCLUSIONS: All Bothrops venoms tested showed cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines 
      through inducing of necrosis and apoptosis.

TI  - Antitumor effect of Bothrops jararaca venom.
PG  - 99-104
AB  - Many experimental studies have been carried out using snake venoms for the treatment 
      of animal tumors, with controversial results. While some authors have reported an 
      antitumor effect of treatment with specific snake venom fractions, others have 
      reported no effects after this treatment. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      effect of Bothrops jararaca venom (BjV) on Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells in vivo 
      and in vitro. In the in vivo study, Swiss mice were inoculated with EAT cells by the 
      intraperitoneal (i.p.) route and treated with BjV venom (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.), on the 
      1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, and 13th days. Mice were evaluated for total and differential 
      cells number on the 2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th and 14th days. The survival time was also 
      evaluated after 60 days of tumor growth. In the in vitro study, EAT and normal 
      peritoneal cells were cultivated in the presence of different BjV concentrations 
      (2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, and 80 microg) and viability was verified after 3, 6, 
      12 and 24 h of cultivation. Results were analyzed statistically by the 
      Kruskal-Wallis and Tukey tests at the 5% level of significance. It was observed that 
      in vivo treatment with BjV induced tumor growth inhibition, increased animal 
      survival time, decreased mortality, increased the influx of polymorphonuclear 
      leukocytes on the early stages of tumor growth, and did not affect the mononuclear 
      cells number. In vitro treatment with BjV produced a dose-dependent toxic effect on 
      EAT and peritoneal cells, with higher effects against peritoneal cells. Taken 
      together, our results demonstrate that BjV has an important antitumor effect. This 
      is the first report showing this in vivo effect for this venom.

TI  - Viperid Envenomation Wound Exudate Contributes to Increased Vascular Permeability 
      via a DAMPs/TLR-4 Mediated Pathway.
LID - 349
AB  - Viperid snakebite envenomation is characterized by inflammatory events including 
      increase in vascular permeability. A copious exudate is generated in tissue injected 
      with venom, whose proteomics analysis has provided insights into the mechanisms of 
      venom-induced tissue damage. Hereby it is reported that wound exudate itself has the 
      ability to induce increase in vascular permeability in the skin of mice. Proteomics 
      analysis of exudate revealed the presence of cytokines and chemokines, together with 
      abundant damage associated molecular pattern molecules (DAMPs) resulting from both 
      proteolysis of extracellular matrix and cellular lysis. Moreover, significant 
      differences in the amounts of cytokines/chemokines and DAMPs were detected between 
      exudates collected 1 h and 24 h after envenomation, thus highlighting a complex 
      temporal dynamic in the composition of exudate. Pretreatment of mice with Eritoran, 
      an antagonist of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), significantly reduced the 
      exudate-induced increase in vascular permeability, thus suggesting that DAMPs might 
      be acting through this receptor. It is hypothesized that an "Envenomation-induced 
      DAMPs cycle of tissue damage" may be operating in viperid snakebite envenomation 
      through which venom-induced tissue damage generates a variety of DAMPs which may 
      further expand tissue alterations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Malignant melanoma is a less common but highly dangerous form of skin 
      cancer; it starts in the melanocytes cells found in the outer layer of the skin. 
      Jararhagin toxin, a metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops jararaca snake venom 
      acts upon several biological processes, as inflammation, pain, platelet aggregation, 
      proliferation and apoptosis, though not yet approved for use, may one day be 
      employed to treat tumors. METHODS: B16F10 murine melanoma cells were treated with 
      jararhagin (jara), a disintegrin-like metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops 
      jararaca snake venom, and jari (catalytic domain inactivated with 
      1,10-phenanthroline). Viability and adhesion cells were evaluated by MTT assay. The 
      expression of caspase-3 active, phases of the cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed 
      by flow cytometry. We analyze in vivo the effects of jararhagin on melanoma growth, 
      apoptosis and metastasis. RESULTS: The tumor cells acquired round shapes, lost 
      cytoplasmic expansions, formed clusters in suspension and decreased viability. Jari 
      was almost 20 times more potent toxin than jara based on IC50 values and on 
      morphological changes of the cells, also observed by scanning electron microscopy. 
      Flow cytometry analysis showed 48.3% decrease in the proliferation rate of cells and 
      47.2% increase in apoptosis (jara) and necrosis (jari), following 1.2 μM jara and 
      0.1 μM jari treatments. Caspase-3 activity was increased whereas G0/G1 cell cycle 
      phase was on the decline. Proliferative rate was assessed by staining with 
      5,6-carboxyfluoresceindiacetate succinimidyl ester, showing a significant decrease 
      in proliferation at all concentrations of both toxins. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo 
      treatment of the toxins was observed reduction in the incidence of nodules, and 
      metastasis and antiproliferative inhibition capacity. This data strengthens the 
      potential use jararhagin as an anti-neoplastic drug.

TI  - BJcuL, a lectin purified from Bothrops jararacussu venom, induces apoptosis in human 
      gastric carcinoma cells accompanied by inhibition of cell adhesion and actin 
      cytoskeleton disassembly.
PG  - 81-5
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.10.012 [doi]
AB  - We show that BJcuL, a lectin purified from Bothrops jararacussu venom, exerts 
      cytotoxic effects to gastric carcinoma cells MKN45 and AGS. This effect was due to 
      the direct interaction with specific glycans on the cells surface and was observed 
      by cell viability decrease, disorganization of actin filaments and apoptosis. In 
      addition, BJcuL was able to reduce tumor cell adhesion to matrigel, what was 
      inhibited by specific carbohydrate or partially inhibited when cells were 
      pre-incubated with matrigel. Our results suggest that BJcuL was able to promote 
      apoptosis in both tumor cells lines and therefore has a prospect for potential use 
      in cancer therapy.

TI  - Blocking αvβ3 integrin by a recombinant RGD disintegrin impairs VEGF signaling in 
      endothelial cells.
PG  - 1812-20
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2012.04.020 [doi]
AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and αvβ3 integrin are key molecules that 
      actively participate in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Some integrin-blocking 
      molecules are currently under clinical trials for cancer and metastasis treatment. 
      However, the mechanism of action of such inhibitors is not completely understood. We 
      have previously demonstrated the anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic properties of 
      DisBa-01, a recombinant His-tag RGD-disintegrin from Bothrops alternatus snake venom 
      in some experimental models. DisBa-01 blocks αvβ3 integrin binding to vitronectin 
      and inhibits integrin-mediated downstream signaling cascades and cell migration. 
      Here we add some new information on the mechanism of action of DisBa-01 in the tumor 
      microenvironment. DisBa-01 supports the adhesion of fibroblasts and MDA-MB-231 
      breast cancer cells but it inhibits the adhesion of these cells to type I collagen 
      under flow in high shear conditions, as a simulation of the blood stream. DisBa-01 
      does not affect the release of VEGF by fibroblasts or breast cancer cells but it 
      strongly decreases the expression of VEGF mRNA and of its receptors, vascular 
      endothelial growth factor receptors 1 and 2 (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) in endothelial 
      cells. DisBa-01 at nanomolar concentrations also modulates metalloprotease 2 (MMP-2) 
      and 9 (MMP-9) activity, the latter being decreased in fibroblasts and increased in 
      MDA-MB-231 cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that αvβ3 integrin 
      inhibitors may induce distinct effects in the cells of the tumor microenvironment, 
      resulting in blockade of angiogenesis by impairing of VEGF signaling and in 
      inhibition of tumor cell motility.

AB  - The connective tissue formed by extracellular matrix (ECM) rich in fibronectin and 
      collagen consists a barrier that cancer cells have to overpass to reach blood 
      vessels and then a metastatic site. Cell adhesion to fibronectin is mediated by αvβ3 
      and α5β1 integrins through an RGD motif present in this ECM protein, thus making 
      these receptors key targets for cell migration studies. Here we investigated the 
      effect of an RGD disintegrin, DisBa-01, on the migration of human fibroblasts (BJ) 
      and oral squamous cancer cells (OSCC, SCC25) on a fibronectin-rich environment. 
      Time-lapse images were acquired on fibronectin-coated glass-bottomed dishes. 
      Migration speed and directionality analysis indicated that OSCC cells, but not 
      fibroblasts, showed significant decrease in both parameters in the presence of 
      DisBa-01 (1μM and 2μM). Integrin expression levels of the α5, αv and β3 subunits 
      were similar in both cell lines, while β1 subunit is present in lower levels on the 
      cancer cells. Next, we examined whether the effects of DisBa-01 were related to 
      changes in adhesion properties by using paxillin immunostaining and total internal 
      reflection fluorescence TIRF microscopy. OSCCs in the presence of DisBa-01 showed 
      increased adhesion sizes and number of maturing adhesion. The same parameters were 
      analyzed usingβ3-GFP overexpressing cells and showed that β3 overexpression restored 
      cell migration velocity and the number of maturing adhesion that were altered by 
      DisBa-01. Surface plasmon resonance analysis showed that DisBa-01 has 100x higher 
      affinity for αvβ3 integrin than forα5β1 integrin. In conclusion, our results suggest 
      that the αvβ3 integrin is the main receptor involved in cell directionality and its 
      blockage may be an interesting alternative against metastasis.

TI  - Antitumoural effect of an L-amino acid oxidase isolated from Bothrops jararaca snake 
      venom.
PG  - 533-42

AB  - An L-amino acid oxidase (BjarLAAO-I) from Bothrops jararaca snake venom was highly 
      purified using a stepwise sequential chromatography on Sephadex G-75, Benzamidine 
      Sepharose and Phenyl Sepharose. Purified BjarLAAO-I showed a molecular weight around 
      60,000 under reducing conditions and about 125,000 in the native form, when analysed 
      by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration, 
      respectively. BjarLAAO-I is a homodimeric acidic glycoprotein, pI approximately 5.0, 
      and N-terminal sequence showing close structural homology with other snake venom 
      LAAOs. The purified enzyme catalysed the oxidative deamination of L-amino acids, the 
      most specific substrate being L-Phe. Five amino acids, L-Ser, L-Pro, L-Gly, L-Thr 
      and L-Cys were not oxidized, clearly indicating a significant specificity. 
      BjarLAAO-I significantly inhibited Ehrlich ascites tumour growth and induced an 
      influx of polymorphonuclear cells, as well as spontaneous liberation of H(2)O(2) 
      from peritoneal macrophages. Later, BjarLAAO-I induced mononuclear influx and 
      peritoneal macrophage spreading. Animals treated with BjarLAAO-I showed higher 
      survival time.

TI  - Purification and partial characterization of two phospholipases A2 from Bothrops 
      leucurus (white-tailed-jararaca) snake venom.
PG  - 319-28
AB  - Two proteins with phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) activity were purified to homogeneity 
      from Bothrops leucurus (white-tailed-jararaca) snake venom through three 
      chromatographic steps: Conventional gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200, ion-exchange 
      on Q-Sepharose and reverse phase on Vydac C4 HPLC column. The molecular mass for 
      both enzymes was estimated to be approximately 14 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The N-terminal 
      sequences (48 residues) show that one enzyme presents lysine at position 48 and the 
      other an aspartic acid in this position, and therefore they were designated 
      blK-PLA(2) and blD-PLA(2) respectively. blK-PLA(2) presented negligible levels of 
      PLA(2) activity as compared to that of blD-PLA(2). The PLA(2) activity of both 
      enzymes is Ca(2+)-dependent. blD-PLA(2) did not have any effect upon platelet 
      aggregation induced by arachidonic acid, ADP or collagen, but strongly inhibits 
      coagulation and is able to stimulate Ehrlich tumor growth but not angiogenesis.

TI  - Leucurogin, a new recombinant disintegrin cloned from Bothrops leucurus 
      (white-tailed-jararaca) with potent activity upon platelet aggregation and tumor 
      growth.
PG  - 123-9
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2011.05.013 [doi]
AB  - Disintegrins and disintegrins-like proteins are able to inhibit platelet aggregation 
      and integrin-mediated cell adhesion. The aim of this study was to produce one 
      disintegrin-like cloned from Bothrops leucurus venom gland and to characterize it 
      regarding biological activity. The recombinant protein was purified by one step 
      procedure involving anion-exchange chromatography (DEAE-cellulose) and presented a 
      molecular mass of 10.4 kDa. The purified protein was able to inhibit platelet 
      aggregation induced by collagen (IC₅₀ = 0.65 μM) and to inhibit growth of Ehrlich 
      tumor implanted in mice by more than 50% after 7 days administration of 10 μg/day. 
      No effects were observed upon adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP)-and arachidonic acid 
      (AA)-induced platelet aggregation. The recombinant protein was recognized by an 
      antibody specific for jararhagin one metalloproteinase isolated from Bothrops 
      jararaca venom, and therefore it was named leucurogin. Anti-angiogenesis effect of 
      leucurogin was evaluated by the sponge implant model. After 7 days administration 
      leucurogin inhibited, in a dose dependent way, the vascularization process in the 
      sponge. Leucurogin represents a new biotechnological tool to understand biological 
      processes where disintegrins-like are involved and may help to characterize 
      integrins that can be involved in development and progression of malignant cells.

AB  - Bothrops mattogrossensis snake is widely distributed throughout eastern South 
      America and is responsible for snakebites in this region. This paper reports the 
      purification and biochemical characterization of three new phospholipases A2 
      (PLA2s), one of which is presumably an enzymatically active Asp49 and two are very 
      likely enzymatically inactive Lys49 PLA2 homologues. The purification was obtained 
      after two chromatographic steps on ion exchange and reverse phase column. The 2D 
      SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the proteins have pI values around 10, are each made 
      of a single chain, and have molecular masses near 13 kDa, which was confirmed by 
      MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The N-terminal similarity analysis of the sequences 
      showed that the proteins are highly homologous with other Lys49 and Asp49 PLA2s from 
      Bothrops species. The PLA2s isolated were named BmatTX-I (Lys49 PLA2-like), 
      BmatTX-II (Lys49 PLA2-like), and BmatTX-III (Asp49 PLA2). The PLA2s induced cytokine 
      release from mouse neutrophils and showed cytotoxicity towards JURKAT (leukemia T) 
      and SK-BR-3 (breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines and promastigote forms of Leishmania 
      amazonensis. The structural and functional elucidation of snake venoms components 
      may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanism of action of these 
      proteins during envenomation and their potential pharmacological and therapeutic 
      applications.

      some biochemical features of Bl-LAAO associated with its effect on platelet function 
      and its cytotoxicity. RESULTS: Bl-LAAO is a 60kDa monomeric glycoprotein. Its 
      N-terminal sequence shows high homology to other members of the snake-venom LAAO 
      family. Bl-LAAO catalyzes oxidative deamination of l-amino acids with the generation 
      of H₂O₂. The best substrates were: l-Met, l-Norleu, l-Leu, l-Phe and l-Trp. The 
      effects of snake venom LAAOs in hemostasis, especially their action on platelet 
      function remain largely unknown. Bl-LAAO dose-dependently inhibited platelet 
      aggregation of both human PRP and washed platelets. Moreover, the purified enzyme 
      exhibited a killing effect in vitro against Leishmania sp., promastigotes, with a 
      very low EC(50) of 0.07μM. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity of Bl-LAAO was observed in 
      the stomach cancer MKN-45, adeno carcinoma HUTU, colorectal RKO and human fibroblast 
      LL-24 cell lines. The enzyme released enough H₂O₂ in culture medium to induce 
      apoptosis in cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The biological effects were 
      inhibited by catalase. CONCLUSION: Bl-LAAO, a major component of B. leucurus venom, 
      is a cytotoxin acting primarily via the generation of high amounts of H₂O₂ which 
      kill the cells. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: These results allow us to consider the use of 
      LAAOs as anticancer agents, as tools in biochemical studies to investigate cellular 
      processes, and to obtain a better understanding of the envenomation mechanism.

AB  - Crotalid venoms are rich sources of components that affect the hemostatic system. 
      Snake venom metalloproteinases are zinc-dependent enzymes responsible for hemorrhage 
      that also interfere with hemostasis. The disintegrin domain is a part of snake venom 
      metalloproteinases, which involves the binding of integrin receptors. Integrins play 
      an essential role in cancer survival and invasion, and they have been major targets 
      for drug development and design. Both native and recombinant disintegrins have been 
      widely investigated for their anti-cancer activities in biological systems as well 
      as in vitro and in vivo systems. Here, three new cDNAs encoding ECD disintegrin-like 
      domains of metalloproteinase precursor sequences obtained from a Venezuelan mapanare 
      (Bothrops colombiensis) venom gland cDNA library have been cloned. Three different 
      N- and C-terminal truncated ECD disintegrin-like domains of metalloproteinases named 
      colombistatins 2, 3, and 4 were amplified by PCR, cloned into a pGEX-4T-1 vector, 
      expressed in Escherichia coli BL21, and tested for inhibition of platelet 
      aggregation and inhibition of adhesion of human skin melanoma (SK-Mel-28) cancer 
      cell lines on collagen I. Purified recombinant colombistatins 2, 3, and 4 were able 
      to inhibit ristocetin- and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. r-Colombistatins 2 
      showed the most potent inhibiting SK-Mel-28 cancer cells adhesion to collagen. These 
      results suggest that colombistatins may have utility in the development of 
      therapeutic tools in the treatment of melanoma cancers and also thrombotic diseases.

AB  - Snake venom metalloproteinase inhibitor BJ46a is from the serum of the venomous 
      snake Bothrops jararaca. It has been proven to possess the capacity to inhibit 
      matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), likely based on its structural similarity to MMPs. 
      This report describes the successful expression, purification, and characterization 
      of the recombinant protein BJ46a in Pichia pastoris. Purified recombinant protein 
      BJ46a was found to inhibit MMPs. Structural modeling was completed and should 
      provide the foundation for further functional research. To our knowledge, this is 
      the first report on the large scale expression of BJ46a, and it provides promise as 
      a method for generation of BJ46a and investigation of its potential use as a new 
      drug for treatment of antitumor invasion and metastasis.

TI  - Structural and functional properties of Bp-LAAO, a new L-amino acid oxidase isolated 
      from Bothrops pauloensis snake venom.
PG  - 490-501
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2008.12.004 [doi]
AB  - An L-amino acid oxidase (Bp-LAAO) from Bothrops pauloensis snake venom was highly 
      purified using sequential chromatography steps on CM-Sepharose, Phenyl-Sepharose 
      CL-4B, Benzamidine Sepharose and C18 reverse-phase HPLC. Purified Bp-LAAO showed to 
      be a homodimeric acidic glycoprotein with molecular weight around 65kDa under 
      reducing conditions in SDS-PAGE. The best substrates for Bp-LAAO were L-Met, L-Leu, 
      L-Phe and L-Ile and the enzyme showed a strong reduction of its catalytic activity 
      upon L-Met and L-Phe substrates at extreme temperatures. Bp-LAAO showed 
      leishmanicidal, antitumoral and bactericidal activities dose dependently. Bp-LAAO 
      induced platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma and this activity was inhibited 
      by catalase. Bp-LAAO-cDNA of 1548bp codified a mature protein with 516 amino acid 
      residues corresponding to a theoretical isoelectric point and molecular weight of 
      6.3 and 58kDa, respectively. Additionally, structural and phylogenetic studies 
      identified residues under positive selection and their probable location in Bp-LAAO 
      and other snake venom LAAOs (svLAAOs). Structural and functional investigations of 
      these enzymes can contribute to the advancement of toxinology and to the elaboration 
      of novel therapeutic agents.

TI  - A novel alpha(v)beta (3)-blocking disintegrin containing the RGD motive, DisBa-01, 
      inhibits bFGF-induced angiogenesis and melanoma metastasis.
PG  - 53-64
AB  - The integrin alpha(v)beta(3) is involved in multiple aspects of malignant cancer, 
      including tumor angiogenesis and metastasis, which makes the receptor a key target 
      for the development of anti-cancer therapies. We report here on the production, the 
      characterization and the in vivo anti-angiogenic and anti-metastatic properties of a 
      novel alpha(v)beta(3)-binding disintegrin, DisBa-01, isolated from a cDNA library 
      made with RNAs from the venom gland of Bothrops alternatus. The 11,637 
      Da-recombinant monomeric form of DisBa-01 displayed an RGD motif and interacted with 
      purified alpha(v)beta(3) integrin in surface plasmon resonance studies, in a 
      dose-dependent and cation sensitive manner. A three-dimensional molecular model of 
      DisBa-01 in complex with alpha(v)beta(3) predicted a large surface of contacts with 
      the beta(3) subunit. DisBa-01 inhibited the adhesion of alpha(v)beta(3)-expressing 
      human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1) and murine melanoma cell line 
      B16F10 to vitronectin (IC(50) = 555 nM and 225 nM, respectively), and transiently 
      inhibited their proliferation without direct cell toxicity, but did not affect the 
      binding nor the proliferation of a human breast cancer-derived cell line 
      (MDA-MB-231) not expressing alpha(v)beta(3). In vivo, DisBa-01 dose-dependently 
      decreased bFGF-induced angiogenesis in a matrigel plug assay in athymic nude mice 
      (IC(50) = 83 nM). When injected intravenously to C57BL/6 mice together with B16F10 
      melanoma cells, DisBa-01 time- and dose-dependently inhibited lung metastasis 
      monitored by bioluminescent imaging. We conclude that DisBa-01 is a potent new 
      inhibitor of alpha(v)beta(3)-dependent adherence mechanisms involved in 
      neo-vascularization and tumor metastasis processes.

TI  - Myotoxic phospholipases A(2) isolated from Bothrops brazili snake venom and 
      synthetic peptides derived from their C-terminal region: cytotoxic effect on 
      microorganism and tumor cells.

AB  - This paper reports the purification and biochemical/pharmacological characterization 
      of two myotoxic phospholipases A(2) (PLA(2)s) from Bothrops brazili venom, a native 
      snake from Brazil. Both myotoxins (MTX-I and II) were purified by a single 
      chromatographic step on a CM-Sepharose ion-exchange column up to a high purity 
      level, showing M(r) approximately 14,000 for the monomer and 28,000Da for the dimer. 
      The N-terminal and internal peptide amino acid sequences showed similarity with 
      other myotoxic PLA(2)s from snake venoms, MTX-I belonging to Asp49 PLA(2) class, 
      enzymatically active, and MTX-II to Lys49 PLA(2)s, catalytically inactive. Treatment 
      of MTX-I with BPB and EDTA reduced drastically its PLA(2) and anticoagulant 
      activities, corroborating the importance of residue His48 and Ca(2+) ions for the 
      enzymatic catalysis. Both PLA(2)s induced myotoxic activity and dose-time dependent 
      edema similar to other isolated snake venom toxins from Bothrops and Crotalus genus. 
      The results also demonstrated that MTXs and cationic synthetic peptides derived from 
      their 115-129 C-terminal region displayed cytotoxic activity on human T-cell 
      leukemia (JURKAT) lines and microbicidal effects against Escherichia coli, Candida 
      albicans and Leishmania sp. Thus, these PLA(2) proteins and C-terminal synthetic 
      peptides present multifunctional properties that might be of interest in the 
      development of therapeutic strategies against parasites, bacteria and cancer.

TI  - Enhancement of the citrulline-nitric oxide cycle in astroglioma cells by the 
      proline-rich peptide-10c from Bothrops jararaca venom.
PG  - 11-9
LID - 10.1016/j.brainres.2010.09.067 [doi]
AB  - The biological activity of the proline-rich decapeptide Bj-PRO-10c, a processing 
      product of the C-type natriuretic peptide precursor protein, expressed in the brain 
      and the venom gland of the pit viper Bothrops jararaca, was originally attributed to 
      the inhibition of the somatic angiotensin-converting enzyme activity with subsequent 
      anti-hypertensive effect. However, recent results suggest broader biological 
      activity may also be involved in the cardiovascular effects of this peptide. Here we 
      show that Bj-PRO-10c enhances and sustains the generation of nitric oxide (NO) by 
      regulating argininosuccinate synthase activity and thereby velocity of the 
      citrulline-NO cycle. Bj-PRO-10c-mediated effects not restricted to the 
      cardiovascular system, since NO production was also induced in cells of astroglial 
      origin. Bj-PRO-10c was internalized by C6 astroglioma cells where it induces NO 
      production and upregulation of the citrulline-NO cycle cells in a dose-dependent 
      fashion. In view of that, astroglial cells function as L-arginine pool for NO 
      production in neighboring neurons, we suggest a regulatory function for Bj-PRO-10c 
      on the metabolism of this gaseous neurotransmitter in the CNS. Moreover, 
      proliferation of astroglial cells was reduced in the presence of Bj-PRO-10c; 
      however, cell death was not induced. Since NO donors have been studied for the 
      treatment of solid cancers, Bj-PRO-10c may serve as structural model for developing 
      drugs to improve the effects of cancer therapy based on the peptide's ability to 
      augment NO production.

      cell proliferation.
PG  - 4023-5
AB  - Lectins have been used extensively as histochemical probes to describe changes in 
      tumor cell surface and are known to influence the growth of cancer cells. In this 
      study, we determined the effect of a lectin from the venom of Bothrops jararacussu 
      (BJcuL) on the proliferation of a number of established human cancer cell lines. The 
      growth of eight cancer cell lines was inhibited in a dose-related manner in the 
      presence of BJcuL lectin. This lectin was most potent as an inhibitor of growth in 
      renal (Caki-1 and A-498) and pancreatic (CFPAC-1) cancer cell lines with 50% 
      inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 1-2 mM. Melanoma (Wm115) and prostate (PC-3) 
      cancer cells showed IC50 values of 7.9 and 8.5 mM, respectively, in the presence of 
      BjcuL lectin whereas colon (Caco-2) and breast (MCF7) cancer cell lines showed no 
      effect. Our results suggest that BJcuL lectin is an effective inhibitor of cell 
      growth in some cancer cell lines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key players in tumor progression, 
      helping tumor cells to modify their microenvironment, which allows cell migration to 
      secondary sites. The role of integrins, adhesion receptors that connect cells to the 
      extracellular matrix, in MMP expression and activity has been previously suggested. 
      However, the mechanisms by which integrins control MMP expression are not completely 
      understood. Particularly, the role of α2β1 integrin, one of the major collagen I 
      receptors, in MMP activity and expression has not been studied. Alternagin-C 
      (ALT-C), a glutamate-cysteine-aspartate-disintegrin from Bothrops alternatus venom, 
      has high affinity for an α2β1 integrin. Herein, we used ALT-C as a α2β1 integrin 
      ligand to study the effect of ALT-C on MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression as well as on 
      tumor cells, fibroblats and endothelial cell migration. METHODS: ALT-C was purified 
      by two steps of gel filtration followed by anion exchange chromatography. The 
      α(2)β(1) integrin binding properties of ALT-C, its dissociation constant (K(d) ) 
      relative to this integrin and to collagen I (Col I) were determined by surface 
      plasmon resonance. The effects of ALT-C (10, 40, 100 and 1000 nM) in migration 
      assays were studied using three human cell lines: human fibroblasts, breast tumor 
      cell line MDA-MB-231, and microvascular endothelial cells HMEC-1, considering cells 
      found in the tumor microenvironment. ALT-C effects on MMP-9 and MMP-2 expression and 
      activity were analyzed by quantitative PCR and gelatin zymography, respectively. 
      Focal adhesion kinase activation was determined by western blotting. RESULTS: Our 
      data demonstrate that ALT-C, after binding to α(2)β(1) integrin, acts by two 
      distinct mechanisms against tumor progression, depending on the cell type: in tumor 
      cells, ALT-C decreases MMP-9 and MMP-2 contents and activity, but increases focal 
      adhesion kinase phosphorylation and transmigration; and in endothelial cells, ALT-C 
      inhibits MMP-2, which is necessary for tumor angiogenesis. ALT-C also upregulates 
      c-Myc mRNA level, which is related to tumor suppression. CONCLUSION: These results 
      demonstrate that α(2)β(1) integrin controls MMP expression and reveal this integrin 
      as a target for the development of antiangiogenic and antimetastatic therapies.

AB  - BlL, a galactose-binding C-type lectin purified from Bothrops leucurus snake venom, 
      exhibits anticancer activity. The current study was designed to elucidate the 
      cellular mechanisms by which BlL induces melanoma cell death. The viabilities of 
      B16-F10 melanoma cells and HaCaT keratinocytes treated with BlL were evaluated. 
      Necrotic and apoptotic cell death, cytosolic Ca(2+) levels, mitochondrial Ca(2+) 
      transport and superoxide levels were assessed in B16-F10 melanoma cells exposed to 
      BlL. We found that treatment with BlL caused dose-dependent necrotic cell death in 
      B16-F10 melanoma cells. Conversely, the viability of non-tumorigenic HaCaT cells was 
      not affected by similar doses of BlL. BlL-induced B16-F10 necrosis was preceded by a 
      significant (2-fold) increase in cytosolic calcium concentrations and a significant 
      (3-fold) increase in mitochondrial superoxide generation. It is likely that BlL 
      treatment triggers B16-F10 cell death via mitochondrial permeability transition 
      (MPT) pore opening because the pharmacological MPT inhibitors bongkrekic acid and 
      Debio 025 greatly attenuated BlL-induced cell death. Experiments evaluating 
      mitochondrial Ca(2+) transport in permeabilized B16-F10 cells strongly supported the 
      hypothesis that BlL rapidly stimulates cyclosporine A-sensitive Ca(2+)-induced MPT 
      pore opening. We therefore conclude that BlL causes selective B16-F10 melanoma cell 
      death via dysregulation of cellular Ca(2+) homeostasis and Ca(2+)-induced opening of 
      MPT pore.

TI  - Gene expression in SK-Mel-28 human melanoma cells treated with the snake venom 
      jararhagin.

AB  - Alternative approaches to improve the treatment of advanced melanomas are highly 
      needed. The disintegrin domain of metalloproteinases binds integrin receptors on 
      tumor cells, blocking migration, invasion, and metastatization. Previous studies 
      showed that jararhagin, from the Bothrops jararaca snake venom, induces changes in 
      the morphology and viability of SK-Mel-28 human melanoma cells, and decreases the 
      number of metastases in mice injected with pre-treated cells. The purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate the molecular effects of jararhagin on SK-Mel-28 cells and 
      fibroblasts, concerning the expression of integrins, cadherins, caspases, and TP53 
      genes. Sub-toxic doses of jararhagin were administered to confluent cells. RT-PCR 
      was performed following extraction of total RNA. Jararhagin treatments induced 
      similar morphological alterations in both normal and tumor cells, with higher IC50 
      values for fibroblasts. Integrin genes were downregulated in untreated cells, except 
      for ITGA6a,b, ITGAv, and ITGB3 which were highly expressed in SK-Mel-28. The 
      integrin expression profiles were not affected by the toxin. However, jararhagin 
      30ng/μl upregulated genes TP53, CDKN1A, CDKN2A, CASP3, CASP5, CASP6, CASP8, and 
      E-CDH in SK-Mel-28, and genes ITGB6, ITGB7, CASP3, TP53, and CDKN1B in fibroblasts. 
      Appropriate jararhagin concentration can have apoptotic and suppressant effects on 
      SK-Mel-28 cells, rather than on fibroblasts, and can be used to develop potential 
      anti-cancer drugs.

AB  - Colorectal carcinoma is one of the most common cancers in adults. As chemotherapy, 
      the first-choice treatment for colorectal carcinoma, is often infeasible due to 
      acquired tumor resistance and several adverse effects, it is important to discover 
      and explore new molecules with better therapeutic action. Snake venom toxins have 
      shown promising results with high cytotoxicity against tumor cells, but their 
      mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here we examined how BjussuLAAO-II, an L-amino 
      acid oxidase isolated from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom, exerts cytotoxicity 
      towards colorectal adenocarcinoma human cells (Caco-2) and human umbilical vein 
      endothelial cell line (HUVEC). A 24-h treatment with BjussuLAAO-II at 0.25 - 
      5.00 μg/mL diminished cell viability by decreasing (i) mitochondrial activity, 
      assessed by reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium 
      bromide and resazurin; (ii) the activity of acid phosphatases; and (iii) lysosomal 
      function, assessed by neutral red uptake. BjussuLAAO-II also increased intracellular 
      levels of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage, as assessed by fluorescence and 
      the comet assay, respectively. BjussuLAAO-II altered the expression of cell 
      proliferation-related genes, as determined by RT-qPCR: it elevated the expression of 
      the inflammatory cytokine genes TNF and IL6, and lowered the expression of the 
      apoptotic-related genes BAX, BCL2, and RELA. Therefore, BjussuLAAO-II induces Caco-2 
      cells death by acting on multiple intracellular targets, providing important data 
      for further studies to assess whether these effects are seen in both tumor and 
      normal cells, with the aim of selecting this drug for possible therapeutic purposes 
      in the future.

TI  - Biochemical and biological characterisation of lancehead (Bothrops venezuelensis 
      Sandner 1952) snake venom from the Venezuelan Central Coastal range.
PG  - 138-149
AB  - Venom fractions isolated from Bothrops venezuelensis were shown to contain a broad 
      spectrum of proteins with varied activities. This study describes venom fractions 
      with coagulant, haemorrhagic, fibrinolytic, proteolytic and antiplatelet activities, 
      and analyses their physico-chemical properties and biological activities via 
      molecular exclusion chromatography, gel electrophoresis and a bioassay battery. The 
      LD50, determined by injecting intraperitoneally serial dilutions of B. venezuelensis 
      venom into mice, was 6.39 mg/kg body weight. Twelve fractions were collected from B. 
      venezuelensis venom using molecular exclusion chromatography. Of these, fractions 
      1-5 and 7-9 showed haemorrhagic activity, and all fractions except 3 and 6 showed 
      fibrinolytic activity. However, none of the fractions had significant gelatinase 
      activity, and only fractions 4-6 demonstrated activity on hide powder azure. With 
      the exception of fractions 1 and 4, all fractions hydrolysed the insulin B-chain. In 
      addition, all fractions as well as the crude venom showed strong procoagulant 
      activity when tested using a Sonoclot Analyzer. Fractions 1, 3, 5 and 9 inhibited 
      platelet function. In this study we have described the activities of the crude venom 
      and its size-fractions from the scarcely studied B. venezuelensis. Haemorrhagic, 
      fibrinolytic, procoagulant and proteolytic activities, and the inhibition of 
      platelet function were detected. This preliminary study paves the way for the 
      identification of specific molecules in B. venezuelensis venom that could have 
      therapeutic potential for cancer and aberrant haemostasis treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) are abundant components of snake venoms that 
      have been extensively studied due to their pharmacological and pathophysiological 
      effects on living organisms. This study aimed to assess the antitumor potential of 
      BthTX-I, a basic myotoxic PLA2 isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom, by 
      evaluating in vitro processes of cytotoxicity, modulation of the cell cycle and 
      induction of apoptosis in human (HL-60 and HepG2) and murine (PC-12 and B16F10) 
      tumor cell lines. METHODS: The cytotoxic effects of BthTX-I were evaluated on the 
      tumor cell lines HL-60 (promyelocytic leukemia), HepG2 (human hepatocellular 
      carcinoma), PC-12 (murine pheochromocytoma) and B16F10 (murine melanoma) using the 
      MTT method. Flow cytometry technique was used for the analysis of cell cycle 
      alterations and death mechanisms (apoptosis and/or necrosis) induced in tumor cells 
      after treatment with BthTX-I. RESULTS: It was observed that BthTX-I was cytotoxic to 
      all evaluated tumor cell lines, reducing their viability in 40 to 50 %. The myotoxin 
      showed modulating effects on the cell cycle of PC-12 and B16F10 cells, promoting 
      delay in the G0/G1 phase. Additionally, flow cytometry analysis indicated cell death 
      mainly by apoptosis. B16F10 was more susceptible to the effects of BthTX-I, with 
      ~40 % of the cells analyzed in apoptosis, followed by HepG2 (~35 %), PC-12 (~25 %) 
      and HL-60 (~4 %). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that BthTX-I presents antitumor 
      properties that may be useful for developing new therapeutic strategies against 
      cancer.

TI  - Colombistatin: a disintegrin isolated from the venom of the South American snake

AB  - Snake venoms are complex mixtures of proteins, which affect the vital biologic 
      systems of prey, as well as humans. Envenomation leads to immobilization by 
      paralysis, cardiac, and circulatory failure. These same venom proteins that cause 
      havoc in the physiologic system could be used as therapeutic agents. Disintegrins 
      and disintegrin-like proteins are molecules found in the venom of four snake 
      families (Atractaspididae, Elapidae, Viperidae, and Colubridae). The disintegrins 
      are non-enzymatic proteins that inhibit cell-cell interactions, cell-matrix 
      interactions, and signal transduction. These proteins may have potential in the 
      treatment of strokes, heart attacks, cancers, osteoporosis, and diabetes. The 
      present study describes the isolation and characterization of a disintegrin 
      (colombistatin) found in the venom of the Venezuelan snake mapanare (Bothrops 
      colombiensis). Colombistatin was purified by a two-step high-performance liquid 
      chromatography procedure, which included reverse phase C18 and size exclusion 
      protein Pak 60. Colombistatin inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation, human

TI  - Cloning, expression, and structural analysis of recombinant BJcuL, a c-type lectin 
      from the Bothrops jararacussu snake venom.
PG  - 344-52
AB  - The lactose-binding lectin from Bothrops jararacussu venom (BJcuL) is a homodimer 
      belonging to group VII of the c-type animal lectins. BJcuL has also been shown to 
      serve as an interesting tool for combating tumor progression by inhibiting cancer 
      and endothelial cell growth. However, detailed structural studies of BJcuL and its 
      biological mechanisms of cytotoxicity are yet to be reported, perhaps because of the 
      non-availability of recombinant proteins in necessary quantities. Intending to 
      increase the present information about structural and consequently the understating 
      of biological studies, the cDNA coding for BJcuL from a venom gland has been cloned 
      and sequenced. The mature protein-coding region was amplified by PCR with specific 
      oligonucleotides, and subcloned into the pET-15b vector to express the recombinant 
      BJcuL in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The deduced amino acid sequence exhibits a 
      high degree of sequence identity with c-type lectins (CTLs) and c-type lectin-like 
      domains (CTLDs). An insoluble and inactive 18.5-kDa protein was overexpressed after 
      1.0mM IPTG induction. The recombinant BJcuL was recovered and denatured in a buffer 
      with 6M urea and purified on a nickel-affinity column. Protein refolding was carried 
      out on this column, during procedure purification, followed by dialysis against CTBS 
      and then by gel filtration for separation of the active dimmer. The refolding 
      process of rBJcuL and the analysis of its structure were confirmed by biological 
      assay, circular dichroism, and MALDI-TOF.

TI  - Isolation and characterization of ellagic acid derivatives isolated from Casearia 
      sylvestris SW aqueous extract with anti-PLA(2) activity.
PG  - 655-66
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.07.011 [doi]
AB  - The Casearia sylvestris SW (Flacourtiaceae) is utilized in folk medicine (Brazil and 
      all Latin American) to treat several pathologic processes as inflammation, cancer, 
      microbial infection and snake bites. Studies showed that C. sylvestris aqueous 
      extract can inhibit many toxic effects caused by snake venoms (or caused by 
      phospholipase A(2) isolated) from different species, mainly of Bothrops genus. 
      Inhibition of enzymatic and myotoxic activities, decrease of edema formation and 
      increase of the survival rate of rats injected with lethal doses of bothropic venoms 
      are some toxic effects inhibited by C. sylvestris. In this study, four ellagic acid 
      derivatives from aqueous extracts of C. sylvestris were isolated, characterized, and 
      tested against effects from both total venom and PLA(2) (Asp 49 BthTX-II) from the 
      venom of Bothrops jararacussu. The isolated compounds were as follows: ellagic acid 
      (A), 3'-O-methyl ellagic acid (B), 3,3'-di-O-methyl ellagic acid (C), 
      3-O-methyl-3',4'-methylenedioxy ellagic acid (D). The inhibition constant values 
      (Ki) for enzymatic activity, as well the IC(50) values found in the edematogenic and 
      myotoxic activities, indicate that the ellagic acid is the best inhibitor of these 
      activities, while compounds C and D are the substances with lowest capacity on 
      inhibiting these same effects. Our results show that the presence of hydroxyls at 
      position 3 or 3' (compounds A and B) increases the capacity of these derivatives on 
      inhibiting these toxic effects. However, the presence of methoxyl groups at position 
      3 or 3' reduced, but did not completely inhibit the capacity of compounds C and D on 
      inhibiting all the toxic effects studied.

TI  - Effect of RGD-disintegrins on melanoma cell growth and metastasis: involvement of 
      the actin cytoskeleton, FAK and c-Fos.
PG  - 1053-63
AB  - The effects and molecular mechanisms of RGD-disintegrins isolated from snake venoms 
      on the growth and metastatic potential of B16F10-melanoma cells were investigated. 
      Jarastatin (JT) from Bothrops jararaca is a ligand of alpha(5)beta(1), 
      alpha(v)beta(3) and alpha(m)beta(2) integrins, flavoridin (FL) from Trimeresurus 
      flavoridis binds preferentially to alpha(5)beta(1) and kistrin (KR) from 
      Calloselasma rhodostoma is a selective ligand of alpha(v)beta(3). When injected 
      simultaneously with melanoma cells in mice, the three disintegrins significantly 
      reduced tumor lung colonization. On the other hand, JT and FL, but not KR, inhibited 
      B16F10 cell growth in vitro. Interaction of JT or FL with melanoma cells induced 
      actin cytoskeleton rearrangement, increasing actin polymerization and FAK 
      phosphorylation. The effect of FL correlates with the decrease in the constitutively 
      high nuclear content of c-Fos, whereas JT interfered with NF-kappaB translocation in 
      melanoma cells. None of the disintegrins produced alterations in the nuclear Erk-2. 
      The results provide further evidence to suggest RGD-disintegrins as potent 
      anti-metastatic agents in vivo, and indicate that their interaction with 
      alpha(5)beta(1) integrin interfere with integrin-couple signaling, down-regulating 
      transcription factors and negatively modulating cell proliferation. These effects 
      may contribute to inhibition of melanoma cell invasion in vivo.

TI  - Antitumor effects of cationic synthetic peptides derived from Lys49 phospholipase A2 
      homologues of snake venoms.
PG  - 263-8
AB  - The effects of two cationic synthetic peptides, derived from the C-terminal region 
      of Lys49 phospholipase A2 homologues from snake venoms, upon various murine tumor 
      cell lines (B16 melanoma, EMT6 mammary carcinoma, S-180 sarcoma, P3X myeloma, tEnd 
      endothelial cells) were evaluated. The peptides are 13-mers derived from Agkistrodon 
      piscivorus piscivorus Lys49 PLA2 (p-AppK: KKYKAYFKLKCKK) and Bothrops asper Lys49 
      myotoxin II (pEM-2[D]: KKWRWWLKALAKK), respectively, in the latter case with slight 
      modifications and with all-D amino acids. All tumor cells tested were susceptible to 
      the lytic action of the peptides. The susceptibility of tumor cell lines was not 
      higher than that of C2C12 skeletal muscle myoblasts, utilized as a non-transformed 
      cell line control. However, in a murine model of subcutaneous solid tumor growth of 
      EMT6 mammary carcinoma, the intraperitoneal administration of pEM-2[D] caused a 
      tumor mass reduction of 36% (p<0.05), which was of similar magnitude to that 
      achieved by the administration of paclitaxel, an antitumor drug in clinical use. 
      Thus, the C-terminal peptides of Lys49 phospholipase A2 homologues present antitumor 
      effects that might be of interest in developing therapeutic strategies against 
      cancer.

TI  - Effects of a low-level semiconductor gallium arsenide laser on local pathological 
      alterations induced by Bothrops moojeni snake venom.
PG  - 1895-902
LID - 10.1039/c3pp50036e [doi]
AB  - Antivenom therapy has been ineffective in neutralizing the tissue damage caused by 
      snakebites. Among therapeutic strategies to minimize effects after envenoming, it 
      was hypothesized that a low level laser would reduce complications and reduce the 
      severity of local snake venom effects. In the current study, the effect of a 
      low-level semiconductor gallium arsenide (GaAs) laser on the local pathological 
      alterations induced by B. moojeni snake venom was investigated. The experimental 
      groups consisted of five male mice, each administered either B. moojeni venom (VB), 
      B. moojeni venom + antivenom (VAV), B. moojeni venom + laser (VL), B. moojeni venom 
      + antivenom + laser (VAVL), or sterile saline solution (SSS) alone. Paw oedema was 
      induced by intradermal administration of 0.05 mg kg(-1) of B. moojeni venom and was 
      expressed in mm of directly induced oedema. Mice received by subcutaneous route 0.20 
      mg kg(-1) of venom for evaluating nociceptive activity and the time (in seconds) 
      spent in licking and biting the injected paw was taken as an indicator of pain 
      response. Inflammatory infiltration was determined by counting the number of 
      leukocytes present in the gastrocnemius muscle after venom injection (0.10 mg 
      kg(-1)). For histological examination of myonecrosis, venom (0.10 mg kg(-1)) was 
      administered intramuscularly. The site of venom injection was irradiated by the GaAs 
      laser and some animals received antivenom intraperitoneally. The results indicated 
      that GaAs laser irradiation can help in reducing some local effects produced by the 
      B. moojeni venom in mice, stimulating phagocytosis, proliferation of myoblasts and 
      the regeneration of muscle fibers.

TI  - Different clotting mechanisms of Bothrops jararaca snake venom on human and rabbit 
      plasmas.
PG  - 733-42
AB  - Bothrops jararaca venom is approximately 3.5 times more effective at coagulating 
      rabbit plasma than human plasma. To investigate this difference B. jararaca venom 
      was treated with several enzymatic inhibitors and the minimum coagulant dose was 
      determined both on plasma anticoagulated with sodium citrate or a mixture of sodium 
      citrate and heparin, and on fibrinogen (both human and rabbit). On human plasma, the 
      thrombin-like component of the venom accounted for c. 60% of the coagulant activity, 
      such activity was negligible on rabbit plasma. The venom had little clotting 
      activity on rabbit fibrinogen. The factor II- and X-activator components could be 
      inhibited by EDTA, EGTA and 2-mercaptoethanol, whereas the thrombin-like activity 
      was inhibited by PMSF. These differences show that (using human plasma) B. jararaca 
      clotting activity is mainly due to the thrombin-like component, whereas the factor 
      II- and X-activator components are more important on rabbit plasma. The delayed 
      action of the thrombin-like enzyme on rabbit fibrinogen may be attributed to the 
      difference between rabbit and human fibrinopeptide A. Thus, the increased coagulant 
      activity on rabbit plasma may be due to a faster rate of activation of factor X, V 
      or II by snake venom enzymes.

TI  - Subpopulations of mononuclear leukocytes associated with inhibition of Ehrlich 
      ascites tumor growth by treatment with Bothrops jararaca venom.
PG  - 29-32
AB  - Snake venoms have been used as antineoplastic substances in several experimental 
      models. We demonstrated in previous studies that Bothrops jararaca venom (BjV) 
      induces inhibition of Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) growth accompanied by an increase 
      of mononuclear (MN) leukocytes in all groups inoculated with EAT and/or venom. The 
      objective of the present study was to characterize the subpopulations of MN 
      leukocytes involved in the inhibition of EAT growth by treatment with BjV. Swiss 
      mice were inoculated with 1.0x10(3) EAT cells by the intraperitoneal route and 
      treated with 0.4 mg/kg of BjV by the same route (Group TV). Treatment was started 24 
      h after tumor cell inoculation and consisted of five intraperitoneal injections 
      performed at 72 h intervals. After 2, 8 and 14 days, groups of animals were 
      sacrificed and the number of B, TCD4 and TCD8 lymphocytes, macrophages and natural 
      killer cells present in the peritoneal cavity was determined by flow cytometry. The 
      control group consisted of animals inoculated with EAT and treated with 0.1 ml of 
      saline under the same conditions as the experimental group (Group T). Two additional 
      control groups consisted of animals not inoculated with EAT and treated with saline 
      or venom. Data were analyzed statistically by the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test 
      for independent samples. On the 2nd and 8th day we observed a difference between 
      groups T and TV (group T > group TV) for all cell types, except natural killer 
      cells, that only differed on the 2nd day. However, on the 14th day there was no 
      difference in MN cells among groups. These data suggest that the inhibition of EAT 
      is related to the toxic action of BjV on tumor cells and/or to the proteolytic 
      effect of the venom on the mediators produced by the cells for growth modulation.

TI  - Cytokine profile of Ehrlich ascites tumor treated with Bothrops jararaca venom.
PG  - 197-201
AB  - We previously demonstrated that Bothrops jararaca venom (BjV) has an antitumor 
      effect on Ehrlich ascites tumor (EAT) cells and induces an increase of 
      polymorphonuclear leukocytes in early stages of tumor growth. It has been reported 
      that this venom presents an important inflammatory effect when inoculated in animal 
      models and in human snakebites, and that cytokine levels have been detected in these 
      cases. To evaluate whether the cytokines can be involved with the suppression of the 
      tumoral growth, we evaluate the cytokine profile in the peritoneal cavity of mice 
      inoculated with EAT cells and treated with BjV. Swiss mice were inoculated with EAT 
      cells by the intraperitoneal route and treated with BjV venom (0.4 mg/kg, 
      intraperitoneally), on the 1st, 4th, 7th, 10th, and 13th day. Mice were evaluated 
      for cytokine levels on the 2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th and 14th day. Analysis was performed 
      using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-2, IL4, 
      IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels in the 
      peritoneal washing supernatant. Results were analyzed statistically by the 
      Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests at the 5% level of significance. We observed that 
      EAT implantation induces IL-6 production on the 11th and 14th days of tumor growth, 
      IL-10 on the 11th day and TNF-alpha on the 14th day. The treatment with BjV 
      suppresses production of these cytokines. In addition, IL-13 was produced by animals 
      that were inoculated only with venom on the 11th and 14th days, and by the group 
      inoculated with EAT cells and treated with venom on the 2nd and 14th days. 
      Furthermore, we suggest that the IL-6 detected in the present study is produced by 
      the EAT cells and the suppression of its production could be associated with the 
      antitumor effect of BjV.

TI  - Identification and analysis of venom gland-specific genes from the coastal taipan 
      (Oxyuranus scutellatus) and related species.
PG  - 2679-93
AB  - Australian terrestrial elapid snakes contain amongst the most potently toxic venoms 
      known. However, despite the well-documented clinical effects of snake bite, little 
      research has focussed on individual venom components at the molecular level. To 
      further characterise the components of Australian elapid venoms, a complementary 
      (cDNA) microarray was produced from the venom gland of the coastal taipan (Oxyuranus 
      scutellatus) and subsequently screened for venom gland-specific transcripts. A 
      number of putative toxin genes were identified, including neurotoxins, 
      phospholipases, a pseudechetoxin-like gene, a venom natriuretic peptide and a nerve 
      growth factor together with other genes involved in cellular maintenance. Venom 
      gland-specific components also included a calglandulin-like protein implicated in 
      the secretion of toxins from the gland into the venom. These toxin transcripts were 
      subsequently identified in seven other related snake species, producing a detailed 
      comparative analysis at the cDNA and protein levels. This study represents the most 
      detailed description to date of the cloning and characterisation of different genes 
      associated with envenomation from Australian snakes.

TI  - Jararhagin, a snake venom metalloprotease-disintegrin, activates the Rac1 GTPase and 
      stimulates neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells.
PG  - 380-4
LID - 10.1016/j.toxicon.2008.04.165 [doi]
AB  - It has been shown previously that the snake venom metalloprotease-disintegrin 
      jararhagin stimulates cell migration and cytoskeletal rearrangement, independently 
      of its effects on cellular adhesion but possibly associated with the activation of 
      small GTP-binding proteins from the Rho family [Costa, E.P., Santos, M.F., 2004. 
      Toxicon 44(8), 861-870.] Here we show that jararhagin stimulates spreading, actin 
      dynamics and neurite outgrowth in neuroblastoma cells, and that this effect is 
      accompanied by the translocation of the Rac1 small GTPase to the membrane fraction, 
      suggesting its activation. Stimulation of neurite outgrowth was observed within 
      minutes and was dependent on the proteolytic activity of the toxin. These results 
      suggest that jararhagin may stimulate neuronal differentiation, being a potential 
      tool for neuronal regeneration studies.

TI  - Effect of BJcuL (a lectin from the venom of the snake Bothrops jararacussu) on 
      adhesion and growth of tumor and endothelial cells.
PG  - 1471-6
AB  - Lectins are polyvalent carbohydrate-binding proteins of non-immune origin. Recently, 
      we have isolated and characterized a lectin from the venom of the snake Bothrops 
      jararacussu. This lectin (BJcuL) has been shown to bind to lactose moieties and 
      induce agglutination of erythrocytes. In the present work, we observed that cells 
      from human metastatic breast cancer (MDA-MB-435) and human ovarian carcinoma 
      (OVCAR-5) cell lines adhere, although weakly, to BJcuL. However, BJcuL did not 
      inhibit adhesion of these cells to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin, 
      laminin and type I collagen. Importantly, viability of these tumor cells and cells 
      from other human tumor cell lines and a bovine brain endothelial cell line was 
      suppressed by BJcuL. These findings suggest that the lectin BJcuL may serve as an 
      interesting tool for combating tumor progression by inhibiting tumor cell and 
      endothelial cell growth.

TI  - The lectin BJcuL induces apoptosis through TRAIL expression, caspase cascade 
      activation and mitochondrial membrane permeability in a human colon adenocarcinoma 
      cell line.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of BJcuL, the lectin isolated 
      from Bothrops jararacussu venom, on human gastric carcinoma is accompanied by the 
      inhibition of extracellular matrix adhesion, cytoskeleton disassembly and apoptosis 
      induction. The present study aimed to evaluate the apoptosis mechanisms triggered by 
      the BJcuL interaction with specific glycans on the surface of HT29 human colon 
      adenocarcinoma cells. The results demonstrated that BJcuL interacts with 
      glycoligands targets on the cell, which were inhibited in the presence of 
      d-galactose. It shows a dose-dependently cytotoxic effect that is inhibited in the 
      presence of d-galactose. A dose-dependent cell aggregation decrease was also 
      observed for the HT29 cells. Analysis of cell proliferation inhibition was assessed 
      by anti-PCNA and demonstrated that lectin diminishes PCNA expression when compared 
      with untreated cells. Differences in apoptotic marker expression estimated by 
      immunohistochemistry revealed that the lectin promotes an increase in TRAIL 
      expression, leading to an increase in the expression of FADD, caspase-8 and Bax. 
      Besides the increased expression of apoptosis-related proteins, our results revealed 
      that the lectin promotes a mitochondrial respiration decrease and a 75% increase in 
      the amount of cytochrome c released. Together these results suggest that the 
      cytotoxicity of BJcuL can sensitize pro-apoptotic proteins in the cytoplasm and 
      mitochondria, leading to the apoptotic cascade.

TI  - Angiotensin-converting enzyme and enkephalinase in human breast cyst fluid.
PG  - 807-13
AB  - Palpable breast cysts with an apocrine epithelial lining (type 1) are reported to be 
      associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer. The composition of breast 
      cyst fluid (BCF) might include those factors involved in this increased risk. In 
      this study peptidase activities that were active against the substrate 
      [125I]metenkephalin-Arg-Phe were detected in BCF. The products were identified by 
      reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as [125I]Tyr-Gly-Gly 
      and [125I]Met-enkephalin. This proteolysis was not inhibited by PCMB, pepstatin A, 
      leupeptin or aprotinin but was by EDTA, showing that the activity was due to 
      metalloproteases. The production of [125I]Try-Gly-Gly was inhibited by 
      phosphoramidon and thiorphan, whereas that of [125I]met-enkephalin was inhibited by 
      captopril and Bothrops jararaca peptide, indicating that these activities are 
      enkephalinase and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) respectively. A fluorometric 
      assay for ACE demonstrated that ACE levels are significantly higher in type 2 BCF 
      than in type 1 BCF (30.8 vs 6.1 nmol hr-1 10 microliters-1, P < 0.001). As the 
      increased risk of cancer is linked to type 1 cysts it is possible that higher levels 
      of peptidase in type 2 BCF reflect a protective environment in the breast in which 
      mitogenic peptide growth factors are neutralised by proteolysis.

TI  - Alternagin-C, a nonRGD-disintegrin, induces neutrophil migration via integrin 
      signaling.
PG  - 4799-808
AB  - Recently, a new protein containing a disintegrin domain, alternagin-C (Alt-C), was 
      purified from Bothrops alternatus venom. Unlike other disintegrins, in Alt-C an ECD 
      amino acid mogif takes the place of the RGD sequence. Most disintegrins contain an 
      RGD/KGD sequence and are very potent inhibitors of platelet aggregation, as well as 
      other cell interactions with the extracellular matrix, including tumor cell 
      metastasis and angiogenesis. The present study investigated the effects of Alt-C on 
      human neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro and the activation of integrin-mediated 
      pathways. Alt-C showed a potent chemotactic effect for human neutrophils when 
      compared to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine peptide (fMLP), a classic 
      chemotactic agent. Moreover, preincubation of neutrophils with Alt-C significantly 
      inhibited chemotaxis toward fMLP and itself. In addition, a peptide containing an 
      ECD sequence presented a chemotactic activity and significantly inhibited chemotaxis 
      induced by Alt-C and fMLP. A significant increase of F-actin content was observed in 
      cells treated with Alt-C, showing that the chemotactic activity of Alt-C on 
      neutrophils is driven by actin cytoskeleton dynamic changes. Furthermore, this 
      protein was able to induce an increase of phosphotyrosine content triggering focal 
      adhesion kinase activation and its association with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. 
      Alt-C was also able to induce a significant increase in extracellular 
      signal-regulated kinase 2 nuclear translocation. The chemotactic activity of Alt-C 
      was partially inhibited by LY294002, a specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
      inhibitor, and by PD98056, a Map kinase kinase inhibitor. These findings suggest 
      that Alt-C can trigger human neutrophil chemotaxis modulated by intracellular 
      signals characteristic of integrin-activated pathways and that these effects could 
      be related to the ECD mogif present in disintegrin-like domain.

TI  - Inhibition of melanoma cells tumorigenicity by the snake venom toxin jararhagin.
PG  - 739-48
AB  - Skmel-28 human melanoma cells were treated with jararhagin (Jara), a 
      metalloproteinase disintegrin isolated from Bothrops jararaca snake venom, and Jari 
      (Jara with the catalytic domain inactivated). Following treatments, monolayer cells 
      lost cytoplasmic expansions acquiring round shapes, detached and formed cell 
      clusters in suspension. Cytotoxicity effect of Jari was dramatically increased at 
      concentrations higher than 0.4 microM, whereas cell adhesion responses did not 
      differ significantly between similar concentrations of Jara and Jari. Treated cells 
      were significantly inhibited to adhere to non-coated wells, as to ECM 
      proteins-coated plates. Migration and invasion were also significantly inhibited in 
      vitro. A decreased proliferation rate was observed in toxin-treated cells. 
      Immunofluorescence staining showed a wide distribution of Jari across the cells. 
      Jara treated cells (67.5%) steady bound anti-jara antibodies after 90 min, while 
      Jari treated cells steady bound only after 6h (57.3%), as determined by FACS. 
      Skmel-28 melanoma cells tumorigenicity was evaluated 180 days after s.c. injections 
      in AIRmin mice. A statistically significant decrease in the ability of Jara and Jari 
      treated cells to promote lung metastasis was observed. These results point to the 
      potential use of this toxin as a tool for applied researches in the clinical field.

TI  - Broad cytolytic specificity of myotoxin II, a lysine-49 phospholipase A2 of Bothrops 
      asper snake venom.
PG  - 1359-69
AB  - The cytotoxic activity of Bothrops asper myotoxin II, a lysine-49 phospholipase A2 
      isoform, on different cell types in culture, was investigated. Myotoxin II caused a 
      dose-dependent cytolytic effect on all cell types tested, characterized by rapid 
      release of cytoplasmic lactic dehydrogenase and drastic morphological cell 
      alterations. Quantitative differences in the susceptibility to myotoxin II among 
      cell types fell within a relatively narrow range, and in general, the toxin was 
      cytolytic at concentrations of 50-100 micrograms/ml (3-7 microM), when assays were 
      performed using culture medium as a diluent. Toxin activity was markedly enhanced if 
      phosphate-buffered saline was utilized instead of medium. The cytotoxic activity of 
      myotoxin III, an aspartate-49 isoform from the same venom, on both endothelial cells 
      and skeletal muscle myoblasts was higher than that of myotoxin II, suggesting that, 
      although phospholipase A2 activity is clearly not required for the induction of cell 
      damage, it may have an enhancing role. In contrast to B. asper myotoxins, other 
      basic phospholipases A2 with myotoxic activity in vivo (notexin from Notechis 
      scutatus, and two enzymes isolated from Vipera russelli venom) did not affect 
      endothelial cells and myoblasts. Pretreatment of cells with neuraminidase, 
      tunicamycin, or protamine, did not alter their susceptibility to myotoxin II. At low 
      temperatures (2-4 degrees C) myotoxin II was devoid of cytolytic effect. Washing and 
      neutralization experiments using heparin with low affinity for antithrombin or mouse 
      monoclonal antibody MAb-3 suggest that at low temperatures myotoxin II binds very 
      weakly to the cells, and that its normal interaction with the putative target is 
      probably not only based on charge, but that a membrane penetration event may be 
      required.

TI  - Mn(2+) ions reduce the enzymatic and pharmacological activities of bothropstoxin-I, 
      a myotoxic Lys49 phospholipase A(2) homologue from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom.
PG  - 668-77
AB  - Bothropstoxin-I (BthTX-I), a myotoxic Lys49 phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) homologue 
      isolated from Bothrops jararacussu snake venom, causes a range of biological 
      effects, including myonecrosis, mouse paw edema, irreversible neuromuscular blockade 
      and lysis of cell cultures. Among eight divalent cations assayed, Mn(2+) was the 
      most effective in reducing mouse paw edema induced by BthTX-I (25 microg). 
      Preincubating BthTX-I with Mn(2+) (1.0mM) reduced mouse paw edema by 70% and 
      myotoxicity by 60% in mice injected i.m. with 50 microg toxin. Mn(2+) (50 microl of 
      a 1mM solution) administered within 1min at the site of toxin injection was still 
      but less effective in antagonising BthTX-I-induced myotoxicity. Mn(2+) (1.0mM) 
      completely prevented BthTX-I (1.4 microM)-induced neuromuscular blockade in the 
      mouse phrenic-nerve diaphragm preparation. Mn(2+) (0.25mM) protected about 85% of 
      NB41A3 cells from lysis when coincubated with BthTX-I (1.0 microM) for 25h. 
      Preincubation with 0.25mM Mn(2+) increased the sensitivity of the cells to 
      subsequent lysis by BthTX-I in the absence of Mn(2+). BthTX-I (1 microM) caused 
      extensive fatty acid release (from 0.8% of the total radiolabeled lipid in control 
      cells to 56% with toxin) when incubated with the NB41A3 cell line for 25h. PLA(2) 
      activity observed in cell cultures after addition of BthTX-I was considerably 
      reduced by 0.25mM Mn(2+). Mn(2+) ions constitute a promising agent to assess the 
      action mechanism and the effects of enzymatic inhibition on the pharmacological 
      activity of Lys49 PLA(2) homologues.

TI  - Prothrombin and factor X activator activities in the venoms of Viperidae snakes.
PG  - 1581-9
AB  - A Ca(2+)-dependent prothrombin activator, carinactivase-1 (CA-1), was previously 
      found in the venom of Echis carinatus leucogaster. In the present study, the 
      activities of CA-1-like enzymes were screened in the venoms of various Viperidae 
      snakes. The addition of 1 mM Ca2+ ions to the venoms of only Echis snakes in 
      Viperidae produced considerably high prothrombin activator activity, indicating that 
      only the Echis snake venoms contain not only the Ca(2+)-independent prothrombin 
      activator, ecarin, but also Ca(2+)-dependent activator(s). CA-1-like activators and 
      ecarin in the venom of each Echis snake were efficiently separated by Blue Sepharose 
      column chromatography. The venoms of the various Viperidae snakes were also examined 
      for factor X activator activity. The venoms of genera Daboia, Vipera, Cerastes, 
      Echis, Calloselasma and Bothrops contained factor X activator activity in the 
      presence of Ca2+ ions. Cerastes cerastes and Calloselasma rhodostoma venoms also had 
      Ca(2+)-independent factor X activator activity.

TI  - Coagulant fractions of snake venom and the control of capillary bleeding during 
      microsurgery of the ear in vivo demonstration.
PG  - 87-92
AB  - In 398 cases of observed capillary bleeding out of total of 968 otological 
      microsurgeries, the i.v. use of Bothrops Jararaca enzyme proved to be highly useful 
      in controlling the bleeding in 79% of those, namely in 318 cases. We may assume that 
      if capillary bleeding is indeed the consequence of some haemostatic deficiency, not 
      always detectable with the routine laboratory preoperative tests, Bothrops Jararaca 
      enzyme is extremely valuable in controlling this bleeding. If however oozing or 
      capillary bleeding is the result of other circumstances, such as insufficient 
      analgesia and neurolepsia, inadequate anaesthetic technique, wrong positioning of 
      the head resulting in venous congestion of the operative region, or local 
      fibrinolysis due to protracted microsurgery, other measures should be taken to 
      correct these conditions which are not due to coagulation defects. Bothrops Jararaca 
      enzyme, given by i.v. route, even in single dose of 2-6 units = 2-6 ampoules, was 
      perfectly tolerated by all the patients without any side effect or allergic 
      manifestations.
